"we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january
this is our place, we make the rules
and there's a dazzling haze
a mysterious way about you dear
have i known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close forever and ever?
and ah, take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my lover
we could let our friends crash in the living room
this is our place, we make the call
and i'm highly suspicious
that everyone who sees you wants you
i've loved you three summers now, honey
but i want 'em all
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close forever and ever?
and ah, take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my lover
ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
with every guitar string scar on my hand
i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
all's well that ends well to end up with you
swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
and at every table, i'll save you a seat, lover
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close forever and ever?
and ah, take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my
oh, you're my, my, my, my
darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
"nice to meet you, where you been?
i could show you incredible things
magic, madness, heaven, sin
saw you there, and i thought
""oh my god, look at that face""
you look like my next mistake
love's a game, wanna play?
new money, suit and tie
i can read you like a magazine
ain't it funny, rumours fly
and i know you heard about me
so hey, let's be friends
i'm dying to see how this one ends
grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend
so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause, you know, i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young, and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name
cherry lips, crystal skies
i could show you incredible things
stolen kisses, pretty lies
you're the king, baby i'm your queen
find out what you want
be that girl for a month
but the worst's yet to come
screaming, crying, perfect storms
i can make all the tables turn
rose garden filled with thorns
keep you second guessing like
""oh my god, who is she? ""
i get drunk on jealousy
but you'll come back each time you leave
'cause darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
so, it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause, you know, i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young, and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name
boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya
boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya
so, it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause, you know, i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young, and we're reckless

"vintage tee, brand new phone
high heels on cobblestones
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
sequined smile, black lipstick, sensual politics
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight, i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby, kiss it better, i
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite
a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls, lose the one
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
but i knew you
playing hide and seek and
giving me your weekends, i
i knew you
your heartbeat on the high line
once in twenty lifetimes, i
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite
to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
but now i'm bleedin'
'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain, i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy, i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water, i
and when you are young, they assume you know nothing
but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me
once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me
you'd come back to me
and you'd come back to me
and you'd come back
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite"
"i stay out too late
got nothing in my brain
that's what people say
that's what people say
i go on too many dates
but i can't make them stay
at least that's what people say
that's what people say
but i keep cruising
can't stop, won't stop moving
it's like i got this music
in my mind, saying it's gonna be alright
cause the players gonna play, play, play
and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate
baby i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
shake it off
heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, baby
baby i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
shake it off, shake it off
i never miss a beat
i'm lighting up my feet
and that's what they don't see
that's what they don't see
i'm dancing on my own
i'll make the moves up as i go
and that's what they don't know
that's what they don't know
but i keep cruising
can't stop, won't stop grooving
it's like i got this music
in my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

and out about the liars
and the dirty dirty cheats of the world
you could have been getting down to this sick beat
my ex man brought his new girlfriend
she's like oh my god
i'm just gonna shake
and to the fella over there with the hella good hair
won't you come on over baby we could shake, shake
cause the players gonna play, play, play
and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate

"i walked through the door with you
the air was cold, but something 'bout it
felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet disposition
at my wide eyed gaze
we're singing in the car getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it's long gone
and that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red
'cause you were looking over me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter
your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses
in a twin size bed
and your mother's telling stories
'bout you on the tee ball team
you tell me about your past
thinking your future was me
and i know it's long gone
and there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to
cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well
and maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'till you tore it all up
running scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
hey you called me up again
just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all all all too well
time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again
but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights
when you made me your own
now you mail back my things
and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf
from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well
cause there we are again and i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well"
"i'm doing good, i'm on some new shit
been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
i thought i saw you at the bus stop, i didn't though
i hit the ground running each night
i hit the sunday matinée
you know the greatest films of all time
were never made
i guess you never know, never know
and if you wanted me, you really should've showed
and if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
and it's alright now
but we were something, don't you think so?
roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense, i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
i had this dream you're doing cool shit
having adventures on your own
you meet some woman on the internet and take her home
we never painted by the numbers, baby
but we were making it count
you know the greatest loves of all time
are over now
i guess you never know, never know
and it's another day waking up alone
but we were something, don't you think so?
roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense, i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
i, i, i persist and resist the temptation to ask you
if one thing had been different
would everything be different today?
we were something, don't you think so?
rosé flowing with your chosen family
and it would've been sweet
if it could've been me
in my defense, i have none
for digging up the grave another time
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one"
"he said ""let's get out of this town
drive out of the city, away from the crowd""
i thought ""heaven can't help me now
nothing lasts forever
but this is gonna take me down""
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad but he does it so well
i can see the end as it begins
my one condition is
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your wildest dreams
wildest dreams, oh
i said, ""no one has to know what we do""
his hands are in my hair
his clothes are in my room
and his voice is a familiar sound
nothing lasts forever
but this is getting good, now
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad but he does it so well
and when we've had our very last kiss
my last request, it is
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your wildest dreams
wildest dreams, oh
you see me in hindsight
tangled up with you all night
burning it down
some day, when you leave me
i bet these memories
follow you around
you see me in hindsight
tangled up with you all night
burning it down
some day, when you leave me
i bet these memories
follow you around
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just pretend
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your wildest dreams
wildest dreams, oh
even if it's just in your wildest dreams
in your wildest dreams, oh"
"we were both young
when i first saw you
i close my eyes
and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
i see the lights
see the party, the ball gowns
i see you make your way
through the crowd
and say hello
little did i know
that you were romeo
you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said ""stay away from juliet""
and i was crying on the staircase
beggin' you ""please don't go""
and i said
romeo take me
somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting
all that's left to do is run
you'll be the prince
and i'll be the princess
it's a love story
baby just say ""yes""
so i sneak out
to the garden to see you
we keep quiet
cause we were dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while
cause you were romeo
i was a scarlett letter
and my daddy said ""stay away from juliet""
but you were everything to me
and i was beggin' you please don't go
and i said
romeo take me
somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting
all that's left to do is run
you'll be the prince
and i'll be the princess
it's a love story
baby just say ""yes""
romeo save me
they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult
but it's real
don't be afraid
we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story
baby just say ""yes""
i got tired of waiting
wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town
and i said
romeo save me
i've been feelin' so alone
i keep waiting for you
but you never come
is this in my head?
i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground
and pulled out a ring
and said
marry me juliet
you'll never have to be alone
i love you
and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad
go pick out a white dress
it's a love story
baby just say yes
oh oh
oh oh oh
cause we were both young
when i first saw you"
"loving him is like driving
a new maserati down a dead end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin
ended so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind
once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright
just before they lose it all
losing him was blue, like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
you never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing
you'd never found out
that love could be that strong
losing him was blue, like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
you never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
oh, red
burning red
remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes
tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
burning red
loving him was red
oh, losing him was blue, like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
you never met
'cause loving him was red
yeah, yeah red
burning red
and that's why he's spinning round in my head
comes back to me, burning red
yeah, yeah
his love was like driving
a new maserati down a dead end street"
"salt air, and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of ""are you sure? ""
""never have i ever before""
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
your back beneath the sun
wishin' i could write my name on it
will you call when you're back at school?
i remember thinkin' i had you
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
back when we were still changin' for the better
wanting was enough
for me, it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
canceled plans just in case you'd call
and say, ""meet me behind the mall""
so much for summer love and saying ""us""
'cause you weren't mine to lose
you weren't mine to lose, oh
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
'cause you were never mine
never mine
but do you remember?
remember when i pulled up
and said ""get in the car""
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all
for the hope of it all
""meet me behind the mall""
(remember when i pulled up
and said ""get in the car""
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all
for the hope of it all
""meet me behind the mall"")
remember when i pulled up and said ""get in the car""

back when i was livin' for the hope of it all
for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all"
"i've been having a hard time adjusting
i had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
i didn't know if you'd care if i came back
i have a lot of regrets about that
pulled the car off the road to the lookout
could've followed my fears all the way down
and maybe i don't quite know what to say
but i'm here in your doorway
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
they told me all of my cages were mental
so i got wasted like all my potential
and my words shoot to kill when i'm mad
i have a lot of regrets about that
i was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
fell behind all my classmates
and i ended up here
pouring out my heart to a stranger
but i didn't pour the whiskey
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
at least i'm trying
and it's hard to be at a party
when i feel like an open wound
it's hard to be anywhere these days
when all i want is you
you're a flashback in a film reel
on the one screen in my town
and i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
at least i'm trying"

like your friends were the night that we first met
went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

like the shoulder that i gave you in the street
cat and mouse for a month or two or three
now i wake up in the night and watch you breathe
kiss me once
'cause you know i had a long night kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright three times 'cause i've waited my whole life
i like shiny things

darling, you're the one i want, and
paper rings and picture frames and dirty dreams
oh, you're the one i want
in the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
when you jumped in first, i went in too
i'm with you even if it makes me blue
which takes me back
to the color that we painted your brother's wall
honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
we wouldn't be standing here so proud, so
kiss you once 'cause i know you had a long night kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright three times 'cause you waited your whole life ah

shining just for you

"once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone

so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been

weepin' in a sunlit room

'til my dying day
i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and you're the hero flying around, saving face
and if i'm dead to you
why are you at the wake?
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet
we gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
you know i didn't want to have to haunt you
but what a ghostly scene
you wear the same jewels that i gave you
as you bury me
i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'cause when i'd fight, you used to tell me i was brave
and if i'm dead to you
why are you at the wake?
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet
and i can go anywhere i want
anywhere i want, just not home
and you can aim for my heart, go for blood
but you would still miss me in your bones
and i still talk to you and when you can't sleep at night
i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
you had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
you turned into your worst fears
and you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
crossing out the good years
and you're cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet"
"rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
her saltbox house on the coast
took her mind off st. louis
bill was the heir to the standard oil name and money
and the town said
""how did a middle class divorcée do it? ""
the wedding was charming, if a little gauche
there's only so far new money goes
they picked out a home and called it ""holiday house""
their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
the doctor had told him to settle down
it must have been her fault his heart gave out
and they said
there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up
what could've been
there goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything
rebekah gave up on the rhode island set forever
flew in all her b**** pack friends from the city
filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
and blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
and losing on card game bets with dalí
and they said
there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up
what could've been
there goes the most shameless woman
this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything
they say she was seen on occasion
pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
and in a feud with her neighbor
she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
fifty years is a long time
holiday house sat quietly on that beach
free of women with madness
their men and bad habits
and then it was bought by me
who knows, if i never showed up
what could've been
there goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
i had a marvelous time ruining everything
i had a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time
i had a marvelous time"

with some other girl""

can't stop thinking 'bout you""
and i, i say ""i've been there too, a few times""

than lovin' a man who didn't know
what he had when he had it
and i see the permanent damage you did to me
never again, i just wish i could forget when it was magic
i wish it wasn't 4 am, standing in the mirror
saying to myself, ""you know you had to do it""
i know the bravest thing i ever did was run
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
but i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
i know i'm probably better off all alone
than needing a man who could change his mind
at any given minute
and it was always on your terms
i waited on every careless word
hoping they might turn sweet again
like it was in the beginning
but your jealousy, oh, i can hear it now
talking down to me like i'd always be around
push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
oh, you never thought i'd run
sometimes, in the middle of the night, i can feel you again
but i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
but i just miss you, and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
i hold onto this pride because these days it's all i have
and i gave to you my best
and we both know you can't say that
i wish you were a better man
i wonder what we would've become
if you were a better man
we might still be in love
if you were a better man
you would've been the one
if you were a better man

"loving him is like driving a new maserati
down a dead end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying
to change your mind once you're already flying
through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright
just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know
somebody you never met
but loving him was red
but loving him was red
touching him was like
realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword
and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like
wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
oh, red burning red 
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
loving him was red
oh, losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red
yeah, yeah, red
burning red 
and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
comes back to me burning red
 yeah, yeah
his love was like driving a new maserati
down a dead end street"
"you booked the night train for a reason
so you could sit there in this hurt
bustling crowds or silent sleepers
you're not sure which is worse
because i dropped your hand while dancing
left you out there standing
crestfallen on the landing
champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
my picture in your wallet
your heart was glass, i dropped it
champagne problems
you told your family for a reason
you couldn't keep it in
your sister splashed out on the bottle
now no one's celebrating
dom pérignon, you brought it
no crowd of friends applauded
your hometown skeptics called it
champagne problems
you had a speech, you're speechless
love slipped beyond your reaches
and i couldn't give a reason
champagne problems
your midas touch on the chevy door
november flushed and your flannel cured
""this dorm was once a madhouse""
i made a joke, ""well, it's made for me""
how evergreen, our group of friends
don't think we'll say that word again
and soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
that we once walked through
one for the money, two for the show
i never was ready so i watch you go
sometimes you just don't know the answer
'til someone's on their knees and asks you
""she would've made such a lovely bride
what a shame she's f***ed in the head, "" they said
but you'll find the real thing instead
she'll patch up your tapestry that i shred
and hold your hand while dancing
never leave you standing
crestfallen on the landing
with champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
her picture in your wallet
you won't remember all my
champagne problems
you won't remember all my
champagne problems"

how we met and sparks flew instantly
people would say 'they're the lucky ones'

now i'm searching the room for an empty seat
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on
oh
a simple complication, miscommunication
has lead to fallout
too many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up i can't break through
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know
is it killing you like it's killing me?

how'd we end up this way?

and trying to look busy
and you're doing your best to avoid me
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should've held me
oh
i'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothing?
i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how
i've never heard silence quite this loud

the battle's in your hands now
but i will lay my armor down
if you say you'd rather love than fight
so many things that you wish i knew

there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry,
the way you move when you walk by
there's ain't nothing bout you
that don't do something for me
i love your attitude, your rose tattoo,
your every thought your smile, you lips
and girl the list goes on and on and on
the way you look, the way you laugh,
the way you love with all you have,
there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry,
the way you move when you walk by
there's ain't nothing bout you
that don't do something for me
the way you look, the way you laugh,
the way you love with all you have,
your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
the way you talk, the way you tease
right now i think you see
there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me"
"i wake up, stretch out
i wonder what you're doing right now
yeah i slept in my makeup again
tell myself i must be crazy thinking about him
i find myself something decent to wear
take the towel out of my hair
about that time you call me
i'm reminded without you i'd be
a stranger in an all night diner
waiting for her love to find her
lonely like a harbor line
that's never seen a boat
just like a line in an old letter
no one ever wrote
i go to work, work all day
i want a tape recorder for everything you say
walk to the car, dig out my keys
start thinking if you were with anyone but me
i'd be a stranger in an all night diner
waiting for her love to find her
lonely like a harbor line
that's never seen a boat
just like a line in an old letter
no one ever wrote
there you are on the street
standing there waiting on me
i show you my new shoes
you say you love them
baby, without you
i'd be a stranger in an all night diner
waiting for her love to find her
lonely like a harbor line
that's never seen a boat
just like a line in an old letter
no one ever wrote
i wake up, stretch out
wonder what you're doing right now...."
"i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now
oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze
we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
you tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
and you were tossing me the car keys, f*** the patriarchy
key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
and i was thinking on the drive down, any time now
he's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer, and we'd swear
to remember it all too well, yeah
maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
running scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all, all, all
they say all's well that ends well
but i'm in a new hell every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age
maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me, who was she?
a never needing ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened
you, that's what happened, you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jokes
sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
and he said, ""it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one""
time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
and i was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
i'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
cause in this city's barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell, i remember it all too well
just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
just between us, do you remember it all too well?
just between us, i remember it  all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it

will my first love be true and real
will i be ready when my heart starts to fall
what will i do when my love comes to call
and my daddy tells me that i light up his world
everday he says, ""darlin you're my best girl.""
he tried to teach me from the very start
the meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
will my love come in a bowl of fire
will it be filled with hope and desire
will my love come in the pourin rain
am i ready for the joy
am i ready for the pain
am i ready for the boy
am i ready for love....for love
i know i'm not a little girl anymore
cause i'm feelin things i've never felt before
sweet sensations and anticipations
calling commotion to my emotions
and i hear the words my daddy said to me
he said be true to yourself and keep your spirit free
and love will find you one way or another
be good to yourself and be good to eachother
will my love come in a bowl of fire
will it be filled with hope and desire
will my love come in the pourin rain
am i ready for the joy
am i ready for the pain
am i ready for the boy
am i ready for love....for love
it's a run around the world and it's movin so fast
though i wanna find a love that's gonna last
a love so strong that it can withstand
the weight of this world in the palm of its hand
will my love come in a bowl of fire
will it be filled with hope and desire
will my love come in the pourin rain
am i ready for the joy

trying to survive

mama makes her cookies and daddy's just

looking for the love
suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

raised on promises
she couldn`t help thinkin that there
was a little more to life
somewhere else
after all it was a great big world
with lots of places to run to
yeah, and if she had to die
tryin she had one little promise
she was gonna keep
oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
make it last all night
she was an american girl
it was kind of cold that night
she stood alone on her balcony
she could see the cars roll by
out on 441
like waves crashin in the beach
and for one desperate moment there
he crept back in her memory
god it`s so painful
something that`s so close
and still so far out of reach
oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
make it last all night
she was an american girl
oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
make it last all night
oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
oh, take it easy now

nt: ""bad blood""   expressão utilizada quando há um
desentendimento, uma rixa do passado entre duas pessoas"
"your beautiful eyes
stare right into my eyes
and sometimes i think of you late at night
i don't know why
i wanna be somewhere
where you are
i wanna be where
you're here
your eyes are lookin' into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm lookin' through your
i'm lookin' through your eyes
i wake up i'm alive
in only a little while
i'll cry
'cause you're my lullaby
so baby come hold me tight
'cause i
i wanna be everything you need
i wanna be where
you're here
your eyes are lookin' into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm lookin' through your
i'm lookin' through your eyes
just as long as your mine
i'll be your everything tonight
let me love you, kiss you
baby let me miss you
let me see your
dream about
dream about
dream about your eyes
eyes
eyes
beautiful eyes"
"follow me home if you dare to
i wouldn't know where to lead you
should i take chances when no one took chances on me?
so i watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
with no beauty in my memory
all that i wanted was to be wanted
too young to wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
at least you have something, something to cling to
visions of dazzling rooms i'll never get let into
and the memories were lost long ago
but at least you have beautiful ghosts
perilous night, their voices calling
a flicker of light before the dawning
out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
scared to call them my friends and be broken again
is this hope just a mystical dream?
all that i wanted was to be wanted
too young to wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
at least you have something, something to cling to
visions of dazzling rooms i'll never get let into
and the memories were lost long ago
but at least you have beautiful ghosts
and so maybe my home isn't what i had known
what i thought it would be
but i feel so alive with these phantoms of night
and i know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free
all that i wanted was to be wanted
i'll never wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
with them, i have something, something to cling to
i never knew i'd love this world they've let me into
and the memories were lost long ago
so i'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
and the memories were lost long ago
so i'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"
"took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels

turn the lock and put my headphones on

but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do
and you throw your head back laughing

i think it's strange that you think i'm funny cause
he never did
i've been spending the last 8 months
thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe
i watched it begin again
you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you

we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy

that your family watches every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
and for the first time
what's past is past

"all is quiet in the world tonight
counting stars and fireflies
this summer sings a lullaby
of just me and my baby
on the hood of his daddy's car
pass around his old guitar
bet mama's wondering where we are
just me and my baby
the world is spinning 'round
'cause of just what i found
ooh, life's so sweet right here
ooh, keeping it young and crazy
ooh, just want to stay right here
'cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
driving home by the riverside
wishing i could slow down time
faking pictures in my mind
of me and my baby
the car pulls up and i'm home too late
we didn't take that interstate
the back road was a better way
for me and my baby
the closer that we get
ooh, i can't leave yet
ooh, life's so sweet right here
ooh, keeping it young and crazy
ooh, just want to stay right here
'cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
both know what we found
so we turned that car around
ooh, life's so sweet right here
ooh, keeping it young and crazy
ooh, just want to stay right here
ooh, and be with my baby
ooh, yeah and be with my baby"

"i live down the street in a broken down house
and a car up on blocks in the driveway
the moment we meet there was never a doubt
that we won't forget this sunday
it starts with a smile and a walk in miles
and it all leads to this: our first kiss
all my friends are saying
girl, what are you thinking?
you're better off, you're better off without him
find yourself another
girl, that boy is trouble
you're better off, you're better off
they can talk forever
they just don't know better
we drive around town in a rusty old truck
somehow it feels like we're flying
don't wanna come down
but they make it so tough
just everyone we know is trying
to push us apart hidden down in our hearts
and they get what they want cause you're gone
all my friends are saying
girl, why are you crying?
you're better off, you're better off without him
find yourself another
girl, that boy is trouble
you're better off, you're better off
they can talk forever
they just don't know better
you come to my door
in the pouring rain
we know what we don't have to say
you hand me a rose and a note that says
we don't have to do things their way
all my friends are saying
girl, what are you thinking?
you're better off, you're better off without him
find yourself another
girl, that boy is trouble
you're better off, you're better off

they just don't know better"
"..now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
ha
time for a little revenge...
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer
and, i had it all; i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from
chorus:
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind,
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge, ha
she lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever present frown is a little troubling
and, she thinks i'm psycho
cause i like to rhyme her name with things, but
sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
chorus:
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind,
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge, ha ha
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him, but haven't you heard
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him, but i always get the last word
whoa
chorus:
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind,
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge,
and do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
cause i don't think you do, oh
do you still feel like you know what you're doing
i don't think you do, i don't think you do
let's hear the applause
c'mon show me how much better you are
see you deserve some applause
cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you can say sabotage"
"betty, i won't make assumptions
about why you switched your homeroom, but
i think it's 'cause of me
betty, one time i was riding on my skateboard
when i passed your house
it's like i couldn't breathe
you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you
but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go f*** myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you
betty, i know where it all went wrong
your favorite song was playing
from the far side of the gym
i was nowhere to be found
i hate the crowds, you know that
plus, i saw you dance with him
you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you
but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go f*** myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you
i was walking home on broken cobblestones
just thinking of you when she pulled up like
a figment of my worst intentions
she said ""james, get in, let's drive""
those days turned into nights
slept next to her, but
i dreamt of you all summer long
betty, i'm here on your doorstep
and i planned it out for weeks now
but it's finally sinkin' in
betty, right now is the last time
i can dream about what happens when
you see my face again
the only thing i wanna do
is make it up to you
so i showed up at your party
yeah, i showed up at your party
yeah, i showed up at your party
will you have me? will you love me?
will you kiss me on the porch
in front of all your stupid friends?
if you kiss me, will it be just like i dreamed it?
will it patch your broken wings?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you
standing in your cardigan
kissin' in my car again
stopped at a streetlight
you know i miss you"
"nice to meet you, where you been?

magic, madness, heaven, sin
saw you there, and i thought
""oh my god, look at that face""

new money, suit and tie

"so this next clip is a session that i had
with max martin and johan shellback and
what we like to do is we like to run a recording
on our phones of everything we're
doing when we're putting a song together
just in case one of us blurts out a cool
melody and then we forget about it
we wanna go back and replay the tape so that we
can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying
so i brought in this idea called
""blank space"" and this was me playing it
for max and johan for the first time and
they're shouting out these production ideas like
you know, the ""oh! "" at the beginning
of the and that ended up in the song
so this is the very beginning stages of a
song on the album called ""blank space""
like
nice to meet you
where you been
i could show you incredible things
diamonds, seasides 
oh my god
i do too
all you think about this time
oh my god
what you heard about me
can't believe what you hear about me
hear about me

and you lose your whip
you might lose your grip
when the landlord tell ya
that you do for rent
and the grass so green
on the other side
make a n gga wanna run staight through the fence
we're never freezed
by two hundred times
but still can't find no food in it
that's foolishness
and sometimes i wonder,
why we care so much about the way we look,
and the way we talk
and the way we act
and the clothes we bought,
how much that cost?
cause it even really matter?
cause the flight is a uphill battle
but y'all tryna climb
with the same ol' ladder
in the same boat,
with the same ol' battle
why so shallow? i'm just asking
what's the pattern setting madness
everybody ain't a number one draft pick
most of us ain't hollywood actors

to every single time
that they play this song
you can say that that's
what bobby ray wrote for us
when the tides get too high
and the sea upon your knees get so deep
and you feel like
you're just another person
getting lost in the crowd,
where your partner, no please
uh, because we won't be near yet,
both of us
but we still stand tall
with our shoulders up
and even though we always a chance to us
these are the things that've molded us
and if life hadn't chosen us
sometimes i wonder where woulda wind up
cause if it was up to me,
i'd make a new blueprint
feel better from the ground up, hey

grabs onto her daddy's hand,
he says ""baby girl what's wrong with you?""
she says ""please don't make me go back there again""
she said ""i wish there was some way to make them stop it""
so he drives down to
that principles office and says
""i didn't bring her up
so they could cut her down
i didn't bring her here
so they could shut her out
i live my whole damn life
to see that little girl smile
so why are tears pouring down
that sweet face?
she wasn't brought up that way""
emily's home late again
he sees that boy drive away
oh, but something is different this time,
she doesn't have too much to say
she said ""he tried but
there's just some things i won't do""
and through the tears
she said ""i couldn't do that to you""
and he said
""i didn't bring you up
so he could wear you down
take that innocent heart
and turn it inside out
i live my whole damn life
to see my little girl's smile
so don't let nobody take that away,
you weren't brought up that way""
the phone rings on a rainy night
says ""it's officer tate""
he said ""sir there's been an accident,
you better come down here right away,
a drunken driver missed an overpass.
and emily, she's fading fast""
he says ""god, i didn't bring her up
to watch them lay her down,
nearly killed me today,
they put her own
momma in the ground
only thing that kept me alive,
was that little girl's smile
so please don't take that away,
it won't be easy taking her today,
she wasn't brought up that way""

"i had to catch my breath
when i saw you there across the room
holdin her hand
i'd have never guessed
that starting over would look so good on you
but here i am
still believing there might come a day
we'll pick up where we left off
and by the way
your eyes are dancing
i'll say the chances of that
are getting slim
and by the way
my hearts still breaking
it's going take it a while
to love again
so many things that i forgot to say
by the way
i should've let you know
all the way's you made me feel alive
i guess it's too late
so i'll just get my coat
and make my way into this breezy night
give you one last wave
maybe you'll drop what you're doing
and come over here and say
i'm looking good
and by the way
your eyes are dancing
i'll say the chances of that
are getting slim
and by the way
my hearts still breaking
it's going take it a while
to love again
so many things that i forgot to say
by the way
you still look amazing
and i must have been crazy
to let you get away
by the way
if you ever wondered
still got the same old number
just in case
i still miss you
and i still love you
by the way
by the way oh"

on the dresser, vacant just like me

same mistakes every time
bridges burn, i never learn
at least i did one thing right
i did one thing right

on a chain round my neck
chain round my neck
not because he owns me
but 'cause he really knows me
wich is more than i can say, i
i recall late november,
holding my breath
slowly i said,
""you don't need to save me
but would you run away with me? ""
yes

ooooooo
you just got off of work,
the last thing you do
is wanna do is go and

remember when the tickets went on sale,
your daughters 14th birthday

you don't know what you miss
when i look into your eyes like this
and you should be in front of me
seeing everything to see
looking at you
check out this view
think of a quiet beach
think of how the waves crash down
think about a summer's eve
no offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you
walking with you
in the light or in the dark
nothing shadows who you are
and you don't know what you missed
when i look into your eyes like this
and you should be in front of me
seeing everything to see
looking at you
check out this view
look outside the window everyday
and see something new
but all i ever wanted was a window
looking at you
and you don't know what you missed
when i look into your eyes like this

"what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
what would happen if god never let it snow
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie
tell me what you would find
you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more
what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wish they would always do
what if happiness came in a cardboard box
then i'd think there was something we all forgot
what would happen if presents all went away
tell me what would you find
you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more
we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind
you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore

"my winter nights are taken up by static
stress and holiday shopping traffic
but i close my eyes and i'm somewhere else
just like magic
in my heart is a christmas tree farm
where the people would come
to dance under sparkling lights
bundled up in their mittens and coats
and the cider would flow
and i just wanna be there tonight
sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too
under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me, ""i love you""
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true
in my heart is a christmas tree farm
there's a light in the barn
we run inside out from the cold
in the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
and they're warm and they're safe
they wake to see a blanket of snow
sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too
under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me, ""i love you""
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true
baby, yeah
and when i'm feelin' alone
you remind me of home
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
and when the world isn't fair
i pretend that we're there
baby, baby, merry christmas 
under the mistletoe watching the fire glow
and tellin' me, ""i love you""
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas

cause everything i want is miles away

mama's in the kitchen, worrying about me
season's greeetings,
hope you're well
well i'm doing alright, if you were wondering
lately i can never tell
i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when you were mine
i've been doing fine without you, really
up until the night's got cold
and everybody's here except you
baby, seems like everyone's got someone to hold
but for me it's just a lonely time
cause there were christmases when you were mine
merry christmas, everybody
it'll have to be something i just say this year
i bet you got your mom another sweater
and were your cousins late again
when you were putting up the lights this year
did you notice one less pair of hands
i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when i didn't wonder
how you are tonight
cause there were christmases when you were mine
you were mine"
"the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth
you still all over me
like a wine stained dress i can't wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war
as the sky turned black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning, that's when i could finally breathe
by morning, gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust
they covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud
but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning, that's when i could finally breathe
by morning, gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
see, i think i am finally clean
ten months sober, i must admit
just because you're clean
don't mean you don't miss it
ten months older, i won't give in
now that i'm clean, i'm never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning, that's when i could finally breathe
by morning, gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean

"i drive around this town
in a mustang with the top down
and six running horses under my hood
well that's good enough for me
don't need the real thing
that's just another thing
for me to try to tame
don't know if i could
it might just break me
i thought there for a little while
every sunset i'd be a riding off with him
snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
that's the closest you'll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
that's the closest to a cowboy
you'll see me
before i met him
i was so sane and grounded
before he taught me how to lie
and crawl out the window
i learned the dirt roads
and i got my heart broken
cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
and how to let go
i thought there for a little while
every sunset i'd be a riding off with him
snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
that's the closest you'll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
that's the closest to a cowboy
you'll see me
it was all a little
wonderful and strange
but i'll never look
at a sunset the same night
snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
that's the closest you'll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
sitting fishing by the river bank
swimming in the water tank
that's the closest you'll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
that's the closest to a cowboy
you'll see me"

what a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
and now that i'm sittin' here thinkin' it through,
i've never been anywhere cold as you.
you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray.
and i stood there lovin' you and washed them all away.
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.
oh, what a shame.
what a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
so just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
and now that i'm sittin' here thinkin' it through,
i've never been anywhere cold as you.
you never did give a damn thing, honey.
but i cried, cried for you.

died for you.
oh, what a shame.

did i shatter you?

wondering where did my baby go?
the fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
sorry for not making you my centerfold
over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments, close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down
the question pounds my head
what's a lifetime of achievement
if i pushed you to the edge?
but you were too polite to leave me
do you miss the rogue
who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
will you forgive my soul
when you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'cause we were like the mall before the internet
it was the one place to be
the mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams
sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments, close your eyes

were you waiting at our old spot
in the tree line
by the gold clock
did i leave you hanging every single day?
were you standing in the hallway
with a big cake, happy birthday
did i paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
a universe away
and when i got into the accident
the sight that flashed before me was your face
but when i walked up to the podium
i think that i forgot to say your name
i'm on a bench in coney island
wondering where did my baby go

sorry for not making you my centerfold
over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments, close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down
when the sun goes down
the sight that flashed before me was your face
when the sun goes down
but i think that i forgot to say your name
over and over
sorry for not making you my, making you my
making you my centerfold"
"we were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger
than the drinks in the bar
""i rent a place on cornelia street""
i said casually in the car
we were a fresh page on the desk
filling in the blanks as we go
as if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
leading us home
i hope i never lose you
hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby, i get mystified by how
this city screams your name
and baby, i'm so terrified of
if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again
windows swung right open, autumn air
jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
we bless the rains on cornelia street
memorize the creaks in the floor
back when we were card sharks, playing games
i thought you were leading me on
i packed my bags, left cornelia street
before you even knew i was gone
but then you called, showed your hand
i turned around before i hit the tunnel
sat on the roof, you and i
i hope i never lose you
hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby, i get mystified by how
this city screams your name
and baby, i'm so terrified of
if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again
you hold my hand on the street
walk me back to that apartment
years ago, we were just inside
barefoot in the kitchen
sacred new beginnings
that became my religion, listen
i hope i never lose you
i'd never walk cornelia street again
oh, never again
and baby, i get mystified by how
this city screams your name
and baby, i'm so terrified of
if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i don't wanna lose you i'd never walk cornelia street again
i don't wanna lose you 
""i rent a place on cornelia street""
i said casually in the car"
"and the tennis court was covered up
with some tent like thing
and you asked me to dance
but i said, ""dancin' is a dangerous game""
oh, i thought
this is gonna be one of those things
now i know
i'm never gonna love again
i've got some tricks up my sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me
never wanted love
just a fancy car
now i'm waiting by the phone
like i'm sitting in an airport bar
you had some tricks up your sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me
perched in the dark
telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
like it could be love
i could be the way forward
only if they pay for it
you're a bandit like me
eyes full of stars
hustling for the good life
never thought i'd meet you here
it could be love
we could be the way forward
and i know i'll pay for it
you're a cowboy like me
perched in the dark
telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
like it could be love
i could be the way forward
only if they pay for it
you're a bandit like me
eyes full of stars
hustling for the good life
never thought i'd meet you here
it could be love
we could be the way forward
and i know i'll pay for it
and the skeletons in both our closets
plotted hard to f*** this up
and the old men that i've swindled
really did believe i was the one
and the ladies lunching have their stories about
when you passed through town
but that was all before i locked it down
now you hang from my lips
like the gardens of babylon
with your boots beneath my bed
forever is the sweetest con
i've had some tricks up my sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me
and i'm never gonna love again
i'm never gonna love again
i'm never gonna love again"
"i've never gone with the wind
just let it flow
let it take me where it wants to go
till you open the door
there's so much more
i've never seen it before
i was trying to fly
but i couldn't find wings
but you came along
and you changed everything
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm falling and i
i'm lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
i watched from a distance as you
made life your own
every sky was your own kind of blue
and i wanted to know
how that would feel
and you made it so real
you showed me something
that i couldn't see
you opened my eyes
and you made me believe
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm falling and i'm
lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
baby you showed me what living is for
i don't wanna hide anymore
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm falling and i'm
lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier,crazier"
"i've been counting days and
i've been being patient
about a little thing called love
crossing all my fingers
letting my heart linger
trying to get some help from up above

and i've been hoping every day
that someday you will find me
so i cross my heart and hope for you

there is something i can do
‘cause i've been on the verge of
running around in circles

"fever dream high in the quiet of the night

bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
you know that i bought it
killing me slow, out the window
i'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
what doesn't kill me makes me want you more
and it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, whoa oh

every night that summer just to seal my fate and i scream, ""for whatever it's worth

"i, i loved you in secret
first sight, yeah
we love without reason
oh, twenty five years old
oh, how were you to know?
and my, my love had been frozen
deep blue, but you painted me golden
oh, and you held me close
oh, oshow was i to know?
i
i could've spent forever
with your hands in my pockets
picture of your face in an invisible locket
you said there was nothing
in the world that could stop it
i had a bad feeling
and darling
you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
people started talking
putting us through our paces
i knew there was no one in the world
who could take it
i had a bad feeling
but we were dancing
dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
yeah, we were dancing
like it was the first time, first time
yeah, we were dancing
dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
yeah, we were dancing
and i had a bad feeling
but we were dancing
i, i loved you in spite of
deep fears that the world would divide us
so, baby, can we dance
oh, through an avalanche?
and say, say that we got it
i'm a mess
but i'm the mess that you wanted
oh, 'cause it's gravity
oh, keeping you with me
i could've spent forever
with your hands in my pockets
picture of your face in an invisible locket
you said there was nothing
in the world that could stop it
i had a bad feeling

dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
yeah, we were dancing
like it was the first time, first time
yeah, we were dancing
dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
yeah, we were dancing

i'd kiss you as the lights went out
swaying as the room burned down
i'd hold you as the water rushes in
if i could dance with you again
i'd kiss you as the lights went out
swaying as the room burned down
i'd hold you as the water rushes in

"he said ""i got me a nice new apartment in the city""
wouldn't you have hated that?
i'm getting by with the broken heart you left me with
he hangs up the phone and she whispers back
""missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee""
he was lying when he said he'd moved to l.a.
he's just hiding now on the other side of town
with his head in his hand, and she's just seven miles away
she's staring at the window and puts her picture down
saying
""missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee""
she almost called him on the night that he rode
three simple words on his goodbye note
missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
and i'll be here today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee
in dark blue tennessee"
"my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else
now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a 20 year dark night
and now i see daylight, i only see daylight
luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
and so i became the butt of the joke
i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked
clearing the air, i breathed in the smoke
maybe you ran with the wolves
and refused to settle down
maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town
threw out our cloaks and our daggers
because it's morning now
it's brighter now, now
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else
now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a 20 year dark night
and now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
and i can still see it all all of you, all of me i once believed love would be but it's golden and i can still see it all back and forth from new york i once believed love would be but it's golden
like daylight, like daylight
like daylight, daylight
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
and i don't wanna think of anything else
now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a 20 year dark night
and now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
like daylight
it's golden like daylight
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go, let it go
i wanna be defined by the things that i love
not the things i hate
not the things i'm afraid of, i'm afraid of
or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
i, i just think that
you are what you love"
"long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wondering which version of you i might get on the phone
tonight
well i stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i should've known
well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and i'll look back and regret how i ignored when
they said: run as fast as you can
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john, i see it all now it was wrong
don't you think 19's too young to be played by
your dark twisted games when i loved you so
i should've known
you are an expert at sorry
and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you've run dry
have tired, lifeless eyes
cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you should've known
you should've known
don't you think i was too young
you should've known"

saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts
i dress to kill my time, i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say, ""i don't know""
and what once was ours is no one's now
i see you everywhere, the only thing we share
is this small town
you said it was a great love, one for the ages
but if the story's over, why am i still writing pages?
'cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts
my heart, my hips, my body, my love
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
gave up on me like i was a bad drug
now i'm searching for signs in a haunted club
our songs, our films, united we stand
our country, guess it was a lawless land
quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
my time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
but i'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
no, it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts 
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
my body, my love, my trust
but it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say, ""i don't know"""

don't rip my heart out

and cried into my hands and said
“are you there do you even care”

don't turn away now and
don't rip my heart out

"hey, i knew i'd run into you somewhere
it's been a while, i didn't mean to stare
i heard she's nothin' like me
i'm sure she'll make you happy
but don't you
don't you smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you?
ah, ah, ah, ah
sometimes i really wish that i could hate you
i've tried, but that's just somethin' i can't do
my heart knows what the truth is
i swore i wouldn't do this
but don't you
don't you smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you?
so i walk outta here tonight
try to go on with my life
and you can say, ""we're still friends""
i don't wanna pretend
so if i see you again
don't you don't you smile at me and ask me how i've been
don't you  , say you've missed me if you don't want me again
you don't  , know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you, don't you?
ah, ah, ah, ah
don't you, ah, ah, ah"
"i like the way you wanted me,
every night for so long baby,
i like the way you needed me,
everytime things got rocky
i was believing in you,
was i mistaken, do you mean... do you mean what you say.
when you say our love could last forever
but i'd rather you be mean,
than love and lie,
and i'd rather hear the truth,
and have to say goodbye,
i'd rather take a blow,
at least then i would know,
but baby, don't you break my heart slow
i like the way you hold me,
every night, for so long baby
i like the way you say my name
everytime things got rocky
i was believing in you
was i mistaken, do you say... do you say what you mean
when you say our love could last forever
but i'd rather you be mean,
than love and lie,
and i'd rather hear the truth,
and have to say goodbye,
i'd rather take a blow,
at least then i would know,
but baby, don't you break my heart slow
you would run around and lead me on forever
while i stay at home still thinking we're together
i wanted our love to last forever
but i'd rather you be mean,
than love and lie,
and i'd rather hear the truth,
and have to say goodbye,
i'd rather take a blow,
at least then i would know,
but baby, don't you break my heart slow"
"hey, dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
when we were younger down in the park
honey, making a lark of the misery
you got shiny friends since you left town
a tiny screen's the only place i see you now
and i got nothing but well wishes for ya
ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
ooh, but you don't like it that way
it's never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
you know, you'll always know me, dorothea dorothea 
ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams
sellin' makeup and magazines
ooh, from you i'd buy anything
hey, dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
when it was calmer, skipping the prom
just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
and damn, dorothea, they all wanna be ya
but are you still the same soul i met
under the bleachers? well
ooh, i guess i'll never know
ooh, and you'll go on with the show
but it's never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
you know, you'll always know me, dorothea dorothea 
ooh, ooh
ooh woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh woo ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
dorothea ah ah
ooh"
"here in my mind the sky looks the same
on every day you loved me
when we started home it started to rain
you put your coat around me
we stood there in the road
you held me so close
but did you ever let go
down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
right here right now, i feel it on my skin
the bitter sting of what we could've been
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain
in through the window i see her with you
i'm soaked to the skin, you're warm and dry
i guess the storm is over for you
but look at the tears here in my eyes
i just stood there like a ghost
as you held her so close
and as i let you go
down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
love like this changes who you are
every kiss you gave me is a scar
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain
all i need is to move on fast
but all i want is to have you back
and it just keeps falling…
down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
right here right now, i feel it on my skin
the bitter sting of what we could've been
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain
down came the rain"
"our secret moments
in a crowded room
they got no idea about me and you
there is an indentation in the shape of you
made your mark on me
a golden tattoo
all of this silence and patience
pining and anticipation
my hands are shaking
from holding back from you
all of this silence and patience
pining and desperately waiting
my hands are shaking from all this
ah, ha, ha, ha ah
say my name and everything just stops
i don't want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so
you could take it off
take it oh, ha, ha, ha ah
carve your name into my bedpost
'cause i don't want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so
you could take it off
take it oh, ha, ha, ha ah
inescapable, i'm not even gonna try
and if i get burned
at least we were electrified
i'm spilling wine in the bathtub
you kiss my face and we're both drunk
everyone thinks that they know us
but they know nothing about 
all of this silence and patience
pining and anticipation
my hands are shaking
from holding back from you

pining and desperately waiting

only bought this dress
so you could take it off
flashback when you met me
your buzzcut and my hair bleached
even in my worst times
you could see the best in me
flashback to my mistakes
my rebounds, my earthquakes
even in my worst lies
you saw the truth in me
and i woke up just in time
now i wake up by your side
my one and only, my lifeline
i woke up just in time
now i wake up by your side
my hands shake
i can't explain this
ah, ha, ha, ha ah

"it was painted red
the stripe was white
it was 18 feet from val to stern light
it was 2nd hand, from a dealer in atlanta
i rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
we put on a shine, put on a motor
built out of love, it made for water
we ran her for years, til' the transister got rotten
a piece of my child hood will never be forgotten
it was just an old plywood boat
a 75 johnson, an electric choke
a young boy two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
i would turn her sharp, i would make it wide
he said you can't beat the way
a old wood boat rides
just a little lake across the alabama line
but i was king of the ocean
when daddy let me drive
just an old half ton short bed ford
my uncle bought new in 64
daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
a couple of burnt valves and he got it going
he'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
off a dirt strip where we'd dump trash
off of thickpin road
i'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet to the pedals
smiling like a hero
who just received his medal
it was just an old hand me down ford
with 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
a young boy two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
i would press that clutch, and i would keep it right
he would say just a little slower son
you're doing just fine
just a little dirt road with trash on each side
but i was mario andretti
when daddy let me drive
i'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
i let them drive my old jeep
across the pastior at our home
maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
and pull out that old memory
and think of me and smile
and say
it was just an old worn out jeep
rusty old floor boards
hot on my feet
a young girl two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
turn it left, and steer it right
straighten up girl, you're doing just fine
just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
but i was high on a mountain
when daddy let me drive
daddy let me drive
oh he let me drive
she's just old plywood boat
with a 75 johnson
and electric choke"
"she didn't have a reason to go, oh no
she didn't have a reason to stay either way
she didn't tell anyone by the first reason
she looked at her keys and found a reason to run
and time stands still when you're nowhere bound
but i understand it somehow
if i could drive all night
would i find my peace of mind
would it be a million miles of cold white lights
and unfamiliar exit signs
i'd just drive on by
just south of knowing why
i didn't really know her that well but i could tell
that her smile was only something to hide behind
she felt so out of touch 'cause she just felt too much
and you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
and time stands still when you're nowhere bound
that's where i'm headed right now
if i could drive all night
would i find my peace of mind
would it be a million miles of cold white lights
and unfamiliar exit signs
i'd just drive on by
just south of knowing why
i don't have a plan
i don't have a map
i don't even know if
i'm ever coming back
i don't have a when and i don't have a where
i don't even know if i'll know when i'm there
but if i could drive all night
would i find my peace of mind
would it be a million miles of cold white lights
and unfamiliar exit signs
i'd just drive on by... i'd just drive on by
drive on... drive on... drive all night
if i'd just drive on... drive on... drive all night
just south of knowing why"
"now he's back in the atmosphere
with drops of jupiter in his hair
he walks like summer and talks like rain
reminds me that there's a time to change
since the return of his stay on the moon
he listens like spring and he talks like june
but tell me did you sail across the sun
did you make it to the milky way
to see the lights all faded
and that heaven is overrated
tell me did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me
while you were looking for yourself out there
now he's back from that soul vacation
chasing his way through the constellation
he checks out mozart while he does tae bo
reminds me that there's room to grow
now he's back in the atmosphere
i'm afraid that he might think of me as
plain or jane told a story about a man
who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
and head back to the milky way
and tell me did venus blow your mind
was it everything you wanted to find
and did you miss me
while you were looking for yourself out there
can you imagine, no love, pride, deep fried chicken
your best friend always stickin up for you
even when i know you're wrong
can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance
5 hour phone conversation
the best soy latte' that you ever had and...me?
but tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
and head back toward the milky way?
tell me did you fall for a shooting star,
one without a permanent scar?
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
can you imagine, no love, pride, deep fried chicken
your best friend always stickin up for you
even when i know you're wrong
can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance
5 hour phone conversation
the best soy latte' that you ever had and...me?"
"turn your dial to 93.7
broadway acts like he's 11
self proclaimed, self
worse mistake ever to land in michigan
i'm just a singer of country songs
just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
but if you listen to just one thing i say
you should turn 93 on
broadway's electric barnyard
i sing a song called tim mcgraw
request it and they'll play it all day long
i sing in stations all day long
but there's nothin like when you're on
the electric barnyard
from a trailer park in st. louis
growin' up not wearin' any shoes
prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day
growin' up the other trailer park girls
couldn't hide their jealousy
cuz she had the only phone for miles
now she uses it as a dj
so you should turn? 93 on
broadway's electric barnyard
i sing a song called tim mcgraw
request it and they'll play it all day long
i sing in stations all day long
but there's nothin like when you're on
the electric barnyard"
"there i was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired, lonely place
walls of insincerity
shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
across the room your silhouette
starts to make it's way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
the lingering question kept me up
2am, who do you love?
i wonder till i'm wide awake
now i'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say,
it was enchanting to meet you
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
this is me praying that this was the very first page
not where the story line ends
my thoughts will echo your name until i see you again
these are the words i held back as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you"
"keep your helmet, keep your life, son
just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
crawling up the beaches now
""sir, i think he's bleeding out""
and some things you just can't speak about
with you i serve, with you i fall down, down
watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
something med school did not cover
someone's daughter, someone's mother
holds your hand through plastic now
""doc, i think she's crashing out""
and some things you just can't speak about
only twenty minutes to sleep
but you dream of some epiphany
just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what you've seen
with you i serve, with you i fall down, down watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
with you i serve, with you i fall down  , down watch you breathe in watch you breathing out  , out 
only twenty minutes to sleep

just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what you've seen"
"everybody's waiting, everybody's watching
even when you're sleeping, keep your eyes open
the tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
playing soldiers just pretending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards winning battles with our wooden swords
but now we stepped into a cruel world
where everybody stands and keeps score
keep your eyes open
everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping, keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
so here you are, two steps ahead
and staying on guard,
every lesson forms a new scar
they never thought you'd make it this far
but turn around, now they've surrounded you
it's a showdown
and nobody comes to save you now
but you've got something they don't,
yeah, you've got something they don't
you just gotta keep your eyes open
everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping, keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes...
keep your feet ready
heartbeat steady
keep your eyes open
keep your aim locked
the night goes dark
keep your eyes open
everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping, keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open

"isn't it funny how many times we can say
we've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
and moved on
that's what we thought
but here i am in the same old car
having myself another same old brown eyed bar*
i won't tell nobody
i won't tell my friends
we'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
and we'll tell each other things
like i need you
you and me
baby this is what we do
i may see
there are people you just come back to
so fall back on me
i'll fall back on you
we always let someone come in between
talking around the truth never saying what we mean
look at all this wasted time
i won't tell nobody
i won't tell my friends
we'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
and we'll tell each other things
like i love you
you and me
baby this is what we do
i finally see
there are people you just come back to
so fall back on me
i'll fall back on you
maybe we'll last
maybe we won't
maybe we'll stop talking
and i'll haunt you like a ghost
but just maybe
you'll get along with me
you and me
baby this is what we do
i see, see
there are people that you come back to
fall back on me

fall back on me
baby i'll fall back on you

staring out the window
like i'm not your favorite town
i'm new york city
i still do it for you, babe

make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
got the wine for you

daring you to leave me just so i can try and scare you

"you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys
will wink at you and say
you know i haven't seen you around, before
cause when you're fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen feeling like
there's nothing to figure out
well count to ten, take in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you're on you're very first date
and he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
and you're mama's waiting up
and you're thinking he's the one
and you're dancing 'round your room
when the night ends
when the night ends
cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
when you're fifteen
and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
but in your life you'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen
when all you wanted
was to be wanted
wish you could go back
and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen,
don't forget to look before you fall
i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la ....
your very first day
take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"
"you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the mornin' of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""you know, i haven't seen you around before""
'cause when you're fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
well, count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough, you're best friends
laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be outta here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feelin' like flyin'
and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
'cause when you're fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin 'round
but in your life you'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then, i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had
to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried
'cause when you're fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
la la la, la la la, la la la la
la la la, la la la, la la la la
la la la, la la la
your very first day
take a deep breath, girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"
"someone struck a match against the night
all i could see was you and i
it was captivating
a perfect little dream inside my head
and then reality crept in
and erased it
for a while i thought that i could hold you
but you were just a temporary high
firefly
you drew me to you
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you don't know it, do you
i wish i could keep you, firefly
firefly
some things are beautiful and free
and just never meant to be caged in
i thought i had you in my hand
i tried to catch you but i can't chase the wind
and every time i reach out to touch you
i remind myself you were meant to fly
firefly
you drew me to you
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you don't know it, do you
i wish i could keep you, firefly
firefly
i'd like to think i'd be all that you wanted
not even that is enough...
firefly
you drew me to you
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you don't know it, do you
i wish i could keep you, firefly
i wish i could keep you, firefly
firefly..."
"it would've been nice to see you coming
but that would've ruined the surprise
it would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
but then the truth would hurt my eyes
it's hard to see a picture drop
before it hits the ground
it's nice to know you're here
and you're helping me down
you were always there when i needed
you could always see me clearly and
you were never looking for a thing
you...i'm singing one for you
it would've been cool to never fall down
but then i never would've seen
that power isn't with the picture perfect person
you taught me better things come from in between
it's hard to see a picture drop
before it hits the ground
it's nice to know you're here
and you're helping me down
you were always there when i needed
you could always see me clearly and

"he says he doesn't believe
anything much he hears these days
he says, ""why fall in love
just so you can watch it go away? ""
he spends most of his nights
wishing it was how it used to be
he spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
i call, just checking up on him
he's up, 3 a. m. , pacing
he says, ""it's not just a phase i'm in""
my voice comes out begging
all this time i didn't know
you were breaking down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go
he seems fine most of the time
forcing smiles and never minds
his laugh is a symphony
when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
i pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
i call, just checking up on him
he's up, 5 a. m. , wasted
long gone, not even listening
my voice comes out screaming
all this time i didn't know
you were breaking down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go
if i was standing there in your apartment
i'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
i'd say i love you even at your darkest and
please don't go
i didn't know
you were breaking down
i'd fall to pieces on the floor
if you weren't around
too young to know it gets better
i'll be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go
i'll be your summer sun forever
at 3 a. m. , pacing
all this time i didn't know
at 5 a. m. , wasted
i'd be in pieces on the floor
forever winter if you go

much he hears these days

"no, nothing good starts in a getaway car
it was the best of times, the worst of crimes
i struck a match and blew your mind
but i didn't mean it
and you didn't see it
the ties were black, the lies
were white
in shades of grey in candlelight
i wanted to leave him
i needed a reason

lyin' to myself

we were cursed
we never had a shotgun shot in the dark
you were drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin', but we'd never get far

ridin' in a getaway car

no, they never get far, oh ahh
no, nothing good starts in a getaway car

the light of freedom on my face

well, he was runnin' after us
i was screamin', ""go, go, go! ""
but with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
and a circus ain't a love story
and now we're both sorry

until i switch to the other side
to the other si i i i ide
it's no surprise i turned you in
'cause us traitors never win
i'm in a getaway car
i left you in a motel bar
put the money in a bag
and i stole the keys

you're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
whiskey on ice, sunset and vine

of you touching my hand in a darkened room
if you got a girlfriend, i'm jealous of her

ocean blue eyes, looking in mine

half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that
i can't keep loving you

i was made to believe i'd never love somebody else
i made a plan, stayed the man who can only love himself
lonely was the song i sang
'til the day you came
showing me a better way and all that my love can bring

half of my heart takes time
half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that

i see this for what it is
but now i'm right down in it, all the years i've given
is just shit we're dividin' up
showed you all of my hiding spots
i was dancing when the music stopped
and in the disbelief, i can't face reinvention
i haven't met the new me yet
there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you
both of these things can be true
there is happiness
past the blood and bruise
past the curses and cries
beyond the terror in the nightfall
haunted by the look in my eyes
that would've loved you for a lifetime
leave it all behind
and there is happiness
tell me, when did your winning smile
begin to look like a smirk?
when did all our lessons start to look like weapons
pointed at my deepest hurt?
i hope she'll be your beautiful fool
who takes my spot next to you
no, i didn't mean that
sorry, i can't see facts through all of my fury
you haven't met the new me yet
there'll be happiness after me
but there was happiness because of me
both of these things, i believe
there is happiness
in our history, across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight, leave it all behind
and there is happiness
i can't make it go away by making you a villain
i guess it's the price i paid for seven years in heaven
and i pulled your body into mine
every goddamn night, now i get fake niceties
no one teaches you what to do
when a good man hurts you
and you know you hurt him, too
honey, when i'm above the trees
i see it for what it is
but now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow
where you used to lay your head
after giving you the best i had
tell me what to give after that
all you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
you haven't met the new me yet
and i think she'll give you that
there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you, too
both of these things can be true
there is happiness
in our history, across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight, leave it all behind

leave it all behind

just when i've begun
to get myself together
you waltz right in the door
just like you've done before
and wrap my heart
'round your little finger
here you come again
just when i'm about
to make it work without you
you look into my eyes
and light those dreamy eyes
and pretty soon i'm wonderin'
how i came to doubt you
all you gotta do
is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses
just leave it up to you
and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind
and fillin' up my senses
here you come again
lookin' better than a body
has a right to
and shakin' me up so
that all i really know
is here you come again
all you gotta do
is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses
just leave it up to you
and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind
and fillin' up my senses
here you come again
lookin' better than a body

here i go

"my only one
my smoking gun
my eclipsed sun
this has broken me down
my twisted knife
my sleepless night
my winless fight
this has frozen my ground
stood on the cliffside screaming, ""give me a reason""
your faithless love's the only hoax i believe in
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do
my best laid plan
your sleight of hand
my barren land
i am ash from your fire
stood on the cliffside screaming, ""give me a reason""
your faithless love's the only hoax i believe in
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do
you know i left a part of me back in new york
you knew the hero died
so what's the movie for?
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
you knew the password so i let you in the door
you knew you won
so what's the point of keeping score?
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
but what you did was just as dark
darling, this was just as hard
as when they pulled me apart
my only one
my kingdom come undone
my broken drum
you have beaten my heart
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do"

while having coffee all alone and lord, it took me away
back to a first glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit in my poems
like a perfect rhyme
took off fast through the green light, go
hey, skip the conversation and you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
and that was the first day
and darling, it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of 'i need you'
and for the first time i had something to lose
well i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the story's got dust on every page
sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
cause darling, it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you
tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in the next room
but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you

before you ask me if i'm alright,
think about what i,
had to do oo, yeah
wake up and smell the break up
fix my heart, put on my make up
another mess i didn't plan,
and i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me,
wish you could only see,
i've got an i heart question mark,
written on the back of my hand.
i'd be fine if you just walked by,
but you had to talk about why,
you were wrong and i was right,
but i can't believe you made me,
sit at home and cry like a baby,
wait right by the phone every night,
and now you ask about you and i,
there's no you and i,
remember what you put me through,
i had to,
wake up and smell the break up,
fix my heart put on my make up,
another mess i didn't plan,
and i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
i wish you'd could only see
i got an i heart question mark,
written on the back of my hand
and when you're home alone at night,
you'll still wonder
why you took everything i had, oh baby
i had a lot about you and i,
there's no you and i,
and i know,
someday you will...
wake up and smell the break up,
realize that we won't make up
it didn't go the way you planned,
and you'll know you didn't beat me,
when you look down and see,
i've got an i heart question mark
written on the back of my hand,
written on the back of my hand
an i heart question mark, yeah
written on the back of my hand"
"once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone
you found me, you found me, you found me
i guess you didn't care, and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard, you took a step back
without me, without me, without me
and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me
'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh oh
trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh oh
trouble, trouble, trouble
no apologies, he'll never see you cry
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see, now i see, now i see
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me, hey
i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground

comes creeping in
that you never loved me
or her, or anyone, or anything

flew me to places i'd never been 'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in

i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign, bad sign
something happens when everybody finds out
i see the vultures circling in dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame that can burn out
it can burn out
'cause they got the cages
they got the boxes
and guns
they are the hunters, we are the foxes
and we run
baby, i know places we won't be found in
and they'll be chasing their tails
trying to track us down
cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places, i know places
lights flash, and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want, we won't hear it
loose lips, sink ships all the damn time
not this time
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
my love

that you didn't look again into
so sorry, don’t worry
i’m sure there are so many girls
who love you like you do
they say i’ve always known
what i wanted.
my friends and enemies
will tell you it’s true
you will find out
i always get it
i know what i want

"throwing pennies at the fountain
when you're standing on a mountain
it's kinda hard to aim
like the tree we carved our names in
there must be an explanation
i guess it didn't get enough rain
i need reasons why you're leaving
well i guess i wished on a plane
i thought was a star
i guess what you wrote on paper
wasn't written on your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess i heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
i thought was a star
diving off into the deep end
always believed you'd be there
when i jumped in
guess it ain't your territory
we had the perfect love story
except the ending
nothing comes true when it comes to you
well i guess i wished on a plane
i thought was a star
i guess what you wrote on paper
wasn't written in your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess i heard you wrong

it's not my fault
i just couldn't see...

"i don't think that passenger seat
has ever looked this good to me
he tells me about his night
i count the colors in his eyes
he'll never fall in love
he swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
i'm laughing 'cause i hope he's wrong
and i don't think it ever crossed his mind
he tells a joke, i fake a smile
but i know all his favorite songs
and i could tell you
his favorite color's green
he loves to argue
born on the seventeenth
his sister's beautiful
he has his father's eyes
and if you ask me if i love him..
i'd lie
he looks around the room
innocently overlooks the truth
shouldn't a light go on
doesn't he know that i've had him memorized for so long
he sees everything in black and white
never let nobody see him cry
i don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine
i could tell you
his favorite color's green
he loves to argue
born on the seventeenth
his sister's beautiful
he has his father's eyes
and if you ask me if i love him..
i'd lie
he stands there, then walks away
my god, if i could only say
i'm holding every breath for you
he'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
i think he can see through everything
but my heart
first thought when i wake up is
my god, he's beautiful
so i put on my make up and pray for a miracle
yes i could tell you
his favorite color's green
he loves to argue
oh, and it kills me
his sister's beautiful
he has his father's eyes
and if you ask me if i love him..
if you ask me if i love him..

in a field behind your yard
you and i have painted pictures in the sky

just listen to the crickest sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i don't want to live without you
i'm only up when you're not down,
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,
it's like no matter what i do...
well it drives me crazy half the time
the other half
i'm only trying to let you know
that what i feel is true...
and i'm only me when i'm with you
just a small town boy and girl
living in a crazy world
trying to figure out what is and isn't true
i'm not on trying to hide my tears
the secret's on my deepest fears
do it, oh nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me

"last night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reaching
even though i know you're not there
i was playing back a thousand memories baby
thinkin bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside til i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
locked up in your arms and our friends were laughing
cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now i'm pacing down the hall
chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
nothings gonna change not for me and you
not before i knew how much i had to lose
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside til i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
if you're out there if you're somewhere
if you're moving on
i've being waiting for you ever since you've been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just wanna see you back at my front door
and i'd say

"make sure nobody sees you leave
hood over your head, keep your eyes down
tell your friends you're out for a run
you'll be flushed when you return
take the road less traveled by
tell yourself you can always stop
what started in beautiful rooms
ends with meetings in parking lots
and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and longing stares
it's born from just one single glance
but it dies and it dies and it dies
a million little times
leave the perfume on the shelf
that you picked out just for him
so you leave no trace behind
like you don't even exist
take the words for what they are
a dwindling, mercurial high
a drug that only worked
the first few hundred times
and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and stolen stares
they show their truth one single time
but they lie and they lie and they lie
a million little times
and you wanna scream
don't call me ""kid, "" don't call me ""baby""
look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
you showed me colors you know
i can't see with anyone else
don't call me ""kid"", don't call me ""baby""

you taught me a secret language
i can't speak with anyone else

i think you know that
it would've worked for a little

you changed everything
you changed the tune
in the middle of the game
you changed everything
you changed the rules
it's not like me to forgive someone quickly
except in the pouring rain
it kills me to say this
it really does, it kills my heart
but i might still love you
or is it me just falling apart
but it's not like me to end something
then change my mind
but in the pouring rain
you changed everything
you changed the rules
in the middle of the game
you changed everything
you changed the rules
and it's not like me to forgive someone quickly
except in the pouring rain
am i winning by losing
oh i told myself i would be losing
but in the pouring rain
can you feel my pain
my teardrops falling down from the sky
in the pouring rain
i can feel no shame

you changed everything

and everybody believed in you
it's alright just wait and see,
your string of lights are still bright to me
oh, who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
still an innocent
did some things you can't speak of
but at night you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then
wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
when everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you
it's alright just wait and see,
your string of lights are still bright to me
oh who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent
time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up too
minds change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to
be brand new
it's alright just wait and see,
your string of lights are still bright to me
oh, who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd

i used to think i would meet somebody there
teal was the color of your shirt
when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
you used to work at to make a little money

gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
were there clues i didn't see?
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh oh ooh ooh
bad was the blood of the song in the cab
on your first trip to la
you ate at my favorite spot for dinner
bold was the waitress on our three year trip
getting lunch down by the lakes
she said i looked like an american singer
time, mystical time
cutting me open, then healing me fine
were there clues i didn't see?
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh ooh ooh ooh
a string that pulled me
out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
something wrapped
all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
chains around my demons
wool to brave the seasons
one single thread of gold
tied me to you
cold was the steel of my axe to grind
for the boys who broke my heart
now i send their babies presents
gold was the color of the leaves
when i showed you around centennial park
hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
time, wondrous time
gave me the blues and then purple pink skies
and it's cool

'cause i don't think that they'd understand
when everything's made to be broken
i just want you to know who i am
and you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
or the moment of truth in your lies
when everything feels like the movies

'cause i don't think that they'd understand
when everything's made to be broken
i just want you to know who i am

sleeping in tents

light pink sky, up on the roof
sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
you've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too

"when your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
you ask for the tab
or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
look at each other like that
when the words of a sister come back in whispers
that prove she was not
in fact what she seemed
not a twin from your dreams
she's a crook who was caught
that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks
in your soul
you know when it's time to go
twenty years at your job
then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
or trying to stay for the kids
when keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks
in your soul
you know when it's time to go
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
fifteen years, fifteen million tears
begging 'til my knees bled
i gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
then wondered why i left
now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
praying to his greed
he's got my past frozen behind glass
but i've got me
that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks
in my soul
i know when it's time to go
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
that will find you the right thing
and you know in your soul
and you know in your soul
when it's time to go
you know, you know, you know, you know
when it's time to go
so then you go
then you go
you just go"
"how's one to know?
i'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
in a faith forgotten land
in from the snow
your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
tarnished but so grand
and the old widow goes to the stone every day
but i don't, i just sit here and wait
grieving for the living
oh, goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine, but it's been promised to another
oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered in you
i wish to know
the fatal flaw that makes you long to be
magnificently cursed
he's in the room
your opal eyes are all i wish to see
he wants what's only yours
oh, goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine, but it's been promised to another
oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered
clover blooms in the fields
spring breaks loose, the time is near
what would he do if he found us out?
crescent moon, coast is clear
spring breaks loose, but so does fear
he's gonna burn this house to the ground
how's one to know?
i'd live and die for moments that we stole
on begged and borrowed time
so tell me to run
or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
and drink my husband's wine
oh, goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine, but it's been promised to another
oh, i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone, your ivy grows
and now i'm covered in you
and i'm covered in you
so yeah, it's a fire
it's a goddamn blaze in the dark
and you started it
you started it
so yeah, it's a war
it's the goddamn fight of my life
and you started it
you started it

stop you putting roots in my dreamland

and you move to me
like i'm a motown beat
and we rule the kingdom inside my room
'cause all the boys and their expensive cars
with their range rovers and their jaguars
never took me quite where you do
and all at once

"last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
once bitten and twice shy
i keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
tell me baby, do you recognize me?
well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
merry christmas
i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying \""i love you\"", i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kissed me now, i know you'd fool me again
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
special
yea yea
a crowded room, friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
i thought you were someone to rely on
me, i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl under cover but you tore me apart
maybe this year, maybe this year
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
i'll give it to someone special"
"i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1:58
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go
away
away?
i do recall now
the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
i ran off the plane
that july 9th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
i can still feel your arms
but now i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is that
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
i do remember
the swing in your step
the life of the party, you're showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
i'm not much for dancing
but for you i did
because i love your handshake
meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day
when i don't miss those rude interruptions
but now i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is that
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
so i'll watch you live in pictures
like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are
and i hope the sun shines
and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and town
but i never planned on you changing your mind
so i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is that
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last"

"one daybreak, one heartache
every once upon a time
that black dress, happiness
bubble baths and borderlines
they mean so much to everyone
but you count them up one by one
clear midnights and clear spotlights
once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
a bluebonnet with rain on it
white winters and leaves that always fall
your black boots
my red flower ring
live for the little things
oil paintings and making every detail turn out right
one last dance, new romance
living for that love at first sight
it means so much to everyone
but you count it up one by one
clear midnights and clear spotlights
once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
a bluebonnet with rain on it
white winters and leaves that always fall
your black boots
my red flower ring
live for the little things
no fighting, black writing
wish upon a star
and give the moon a smile
pretending, defending
take a risk and go along for the ride
strawberries and fairies with wings
live for the little things"

"i said remember this moment
in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds and stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age
long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
i said remember this feeling
i passed the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
wishing for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming, ""this is absurd""
'cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
i was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break or fall
can you take a moment
promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children someday
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name
tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life with you
long, long live the walls we crashed through
how the candlelight shined just for me and you
and i was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid
singing long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
and long, long live the look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered"
"fatefully
i tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
misery
like the war of words i shouted in my sleep
and you passed right by
i was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
the knife cuts both ways
if the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
and i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short, it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
clung to the nearest lips
long story short, it was the wrong guy
now i'm all about you
i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah
i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah
actually
i always felt i must look better in the rear view
missing me
at the golden gates they once held the keys to
when i dropped my sword
i threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
and we live in peace
but if someone comes at us, this time, i'm ready
'cause i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short, it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
clung to the nearest lips
long story short, it was the wrong guy
now i'm all about you
i'm all about you, ah
yeah, yeah
i'm all about you
no more keepin' score

pushed from the precipice

"i got a lying smile i never put out for you
cuz i guess i never felt like i really needed to
and they say little girls have big dreams
and nothing in the world was going to come between me
and you
and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spent a long time finding out
love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing, it'd be a long time going
they say it's better to have lost than never to have
loved at all
and i say whoever said that didn't have to far to fall
and they say little girls are so naïve
that wasn't how it was supposed to be
with me and you
and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spent a long time finding out
love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing, it'd be a long time going
i burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
washed my sins on the neon lights
and i'm still not over you
and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spent a long time finding all
the things around after you walk out
not knowing, it would be a long time going
a long time going
and it would be a long time, long time going
it would be a long time, long time going

letting it go
and loving you so

i'm gonna look at you like that
i'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
to your sneak attack
if it's the last thing that i do
i'm gonna make this hard on you while i
look at you like that
don't you say
that we can still be friends
it doesn't work that way
the end is the end
and don't you dare think
that i'll pack up all my tears and take them home
and cry them out when i'm alone
i'll do it right here
i'm crying right now
baby you can watch me crumble down
that's for breaking my heart
so baby don't start
thinking you can ask me not to look at you like that
i'm gonna look at you like that
i'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
to your sneak attack
if it's the last thing that i do
i'm gonna make this hard on you while i
look at you like that
don't you tell me to be strong
or make it harder than it has to be
after you are gone
you'll remember what you've done to me
cause i'm gonna look at you like that
i'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
to your sneak attack
if it's the last thing that i do
after what you put me through
i'm gonna have to let you know
how much it hurts to let you go
oh yeah
gonna look at you like that
look at you

maybe i'm wrong but i don't think romeo would be my kind of guy
i want a love that's sweeter than roses
and for me this is how it's gonna be
like there's a fairytale guy
and he whispers sweet lullabies
and the music plays from nowhere
as we dance in the pale moonlight
with candles and fireflies all night
everybody thinks about love
i want love they haven't thought of yet
here on the couch with a box of chocolates that i bought myself
i'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
it's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
i don't regret it ‘cause it needs to be perfect
like there's a fairytale guy
and he whispers sweet lullabies
and the music plays from nowhere
as we dance in the pale moonlight
with candles and fireflies all night
everybody thinks about love
i want love they haven't thought of yet
i want my own little storybook ending
we'll make it up as we go
there's a fairytale guy
and he whispers sweet lullabies
and the music plays from nowhere
as we dance in the pale moonlight
with candles and fireflies all night
everybody thinks about love
i want love they haven't thought of yet
i want love they haven't thought of yet"

sorry for the ending, i didn't mean to let you down
we were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see
that to me you were the perfect view of misery
i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the days he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
and in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose
let's talk about that golden boy that i met on a winter night
how was i supposed to know that he was just as cold as ice
he smiled and i smiled for the cameras in your mind
and i lied and swore that everything was fine
i never told you about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never told you about the days he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
and in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose
i know you wanna talk around me
how i gave up on love so foolishly
but keep in mind...
i never told you about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never told you about the days he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault

"we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january

can we always be this close?
forever and ever, ah
ah, take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my lover
we could let our friends crash in the living room
this is our place, we make the call
and i'm highly suspicious
that everyone who sees you wants you
i've loved you three summers now, honey
but i want 'em all
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close?
forever and ever, ah
take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my lover
ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
with every guitar string scar on my hand
i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
all's well that ends well to end up with you
swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
and at every table, i'll save you a seat, lover
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close?
forever and ever, ah

everybody loves that mandolin
got his problems, bills to pay

through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

who never really wanted fame
his feet are planted firmly on the ground
he never wanted people to remember his name
he never wanted word to get around

you'd always go past where our feet could touch
and i complained the whole way there
the car ride back and up the stairs
i should've asked you questions
i should've asked you how to be
asked you to write it down for me
should've kept every grocery store receipt
'cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
watched as you signed your name marjorie
all your closets of backlogged dreams
and how you left them all to me
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive, so alive
and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were singing to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around
i know better
but i still feel you all around
i know better
but you're still around"
"she said, i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky, the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
you never did, you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids, you and i
oh my my my my
i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my
take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a. m. riding in your truck
and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside til the morning light
oh my my my my
a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me, got down on one knee
take me back to the time
when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time, you and i
i'll be eighty seven; you'll be eighty nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky, oh my my my"
"this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
he said ""let's get out of this town
drive out of the city, away from the crowd""
i thought ""heaven can't help me now
nothing lasts forever
but this is gonna take me down""
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad but he does it so well
i can see the end as it begins
my one condition is
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh
wildest dreams, oh
i said, ""no one has to know what we do""
his hands are in my hair
his clothes are in my room
and his voice is a familiar sound
nothing lasts forever
but this is getting good now
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad but he does it so well
and when we've had our very last kiss
my last request, it is
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again

"i shined your shoes
i poured the wine
i gave you all of my time
i patched your fake smile
against your friends
which apparently is a crime
i gave you space
you took my place
and gave it to her
but life's too long
to waste it all loving a liar
and when love hands me matches now
i'm gonna burn it down
i keyed her car
got my guitar
and wrote this damn song
look what you've found
she's been around
i hear the lines long
and don't you tell me
to be nice
i'm not a nice girl
she died from complications
of the things you told her
so when love hands me matches now
i'm gonna burn it down
ain't it funny
you said honey
you meant sitting duck
well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
just a few i've thought of
and when love hands me matches now
'gonna burn it down
i'm gonna burn it down
oh yeah
gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

"me and britney
me and britney used to sip on the front porch
drinking lemonade
talk about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
in a summer shade
she said she was gonna be a moviestar
and i said she was crazy
catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
just me and britney
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
we were babies, we were beautiful and free
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
there was nothing that was out of reach
me and britney
she never made it to hollywood
but she made it to memphis
this little old town just hasn't been the same since
that boy she went out with, well i thought he was crazy
maybe i was just jealous it would come between me and britney
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
she was in love, she was beautiful and free
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
she was always so much braver than me
when the phone rang in the middle of the night
before she said a word i knew it was her
she said ""i'm sorry for waking you up
but i didn't know who else to call
or where else to go""
me and britney sat down on the front porch
talking 'bout love and how it changes things
changes people and changes names
everything but me and britney
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
we're not as young, but we're still beautiful and free
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
even when we're old, we're still gonna be me and britney
sittin' on the front porch
drinking lemonade
talking 'bout things no one else was ever gonna hear
in a summer shade"
"you, with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you, have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like i'm nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you, pickin' on the weaker man
well you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you don't know, what you don't know
someday, i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
you, with your switching sides
and your walk by lies and your humiliation
you, have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down
trying to block you out cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
you can't lead me down that road
you don't know, what you don't know
someday, i'll be, living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion but
nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean,
all you are is mean.
and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life,
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
but someday, i'll be, living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean yeah
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so ?
someday, i'll be, living in a big old city

"vintage tee, brand new phone
high heels on cobblestones
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
sequined smile, black lipstick, sensual politics
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain, i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy, i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water, i
'cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing
but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me
once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me
you'd come back to me
and you'd come back to me
and you'd come back
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite
and you'd come back to me
salt air, and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of ""are you sure? ""
""never have i ever before""
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
back when we were still changin' for the better
wanting was enough
for me, it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
canceled plans just in case you'd call
and say, ""meet me behind the mall""
so much for summer love and saying ""us""
'cause you weren't mine to lose
you weren't mine to lose
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a 90's trend
wait for the signal and i'll meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an open shut case
i guess i should've known from the look on your face
every bait and switch was a work of art
the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand, wreck my plans
that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand, wreck my plans
that's my man
the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand, wreck my plans
that's my man"

"oh oh ooo o
oh oh ooo o
you were in college working part time waiting tables
left the small town never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
i say ""can you believe it?""
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there is a drawer of my things at your place
you learned my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you said we'd never make my parents' mistakes
but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes, yes
this is what i thought about
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
woah oh oo
and i remember that fight, 2:30 a.m
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
and i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
'cause that's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said ""i'll never leave you alone""
you said
""i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine""
hold on
make it last
hold on
never turn back
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

yeah yeah...
do you believe it?
woah oh
we're gonna make it now
woah oh

running through rose thorns

voted most likely to run away with you
my team is losing, battered and bruising
i see the high fives between the bad guys

who seems to care
american stories burning before me

boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?

rolling through a valley
watching all my life go by
you're a distant memory
you're an exit sign

on the driver's side

but i can't confess
was that blood or a wine stain
on your wedding dress?

tearing up a good july
i'm going back to nashville
laughing at a bad break
what's the use in wondering why?
maybe i'm a storm front
rolling through the valley
tearing up a good july
going back to nashville
i'm going back to nashville
going back to naaaaahh....
going back to nashville
what's the use in wondering why?"
"i need you now
read letters that i wrote on the wall
and the message that i left when i called
i need you now
words i said drowned out by the rain
waiting there for you but you never came
my world's a little colder now
but i'm keeping warm somehow
so here you are at my window
guess nobody told you
i don't need don't need you
and i waited so frustrated
who's gonna hold you
i don't need you don't need you now
i need you now
words i heard you whisper to me
we were walking down a one way street
you need me now
that's what you've been telling my friends
that i've come too far to go back there again
my heart my mind and number have changed
you might as well forget my name
so here you are at my window
guess nobody told you
i don't need don't need you
and i waited so frustrated
who's gonna hold you
i don't need you don't need you now
i need you now

"i think you fell off of your cloud today
you didn't see it coming or did you
you tried to please everybody
but the sweet breeze swept you away
the sun goes down on a good day
tomorrow is still an unknown
you think you're all alone in this place
i think you're crazy 'cause i still love you baby
oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
never fade
hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
somebody blows your candle out
you wore a mask, now that's broken too
everybody else was everything to you
the sun goes down on a good day
tomorrow is still an unknown
you think everybody wants a fight
i think you're crazy 'cause i still love you baby
oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
never fade
i think you fell out of the sky today
i think you know it's true
you've seen the world, now all you see is me
tell me now baby what are you gonna do
oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
don't fade away
don't fade away
never fade"
"your little hands wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight
to you, everything's funny
you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have, honey
if you could stay like that
oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
just stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
no one will desert you
just try to never grow up
never grow up
you're in the car on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mama's dropping you off
at 14, there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out
someday and call your own shots
but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember she's getting older too
and don't lose the way that you dance around in your
pjs getting ready for school
oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
just stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you
nothing's ever left you scared
even though you want to, just try to never grow up
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i had is someday gonna be gone
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
wish i'd never grown up
i wish i'd never grown up
oh i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up
could still be little
oh i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up
it could still be simple
oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
just stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
it could stay this simple
won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to, please try to never grow up
don't you ever grow up
just never grow up"

from the stars
and everytime i look at you i can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
and it hits me then
i love you
and everytime you look at me i could go crazy
but i don't say it but i won't
cause i'd rather be alone
than lose you
and all i really wanna do is be next to you
but i'm too tired to fight
and i could tell you now

"we're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just aren't coming
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better
we're so young, we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb we know exactly what we're doing
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey life is just a class room
cause baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and everyday is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
we're the new romantics
come on,come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we're too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby were the new romantics
the best people in life are free
we're all here the lights and boys are blinding
we hang back it's all in the timing
it's poker, you can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace
we need love but all we want is danger
we team up and switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but honey most of them are true
cause baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and everyday is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
we're the new romantics
come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we're too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby were the new romantics
the best people in life are free
please take my hand and
please take me dancing and
please leave me stranded
it's so romantic, so romantic
cause baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and everyday is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
cause baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and everyday is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
we're the new romantics
come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we're too busy dancing

why didn't your call,
why didn't you write.
was it cause of him or was it just
cause you don't love me anymore.
you could have found some way to contact me.
but i know it's not my fault
once hes gone i know you'll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner,
i wouldn't have had to live my life this way.
now that he's gone will i get to see you again
at least hear your voice again
i think its gonna workout this time around
we can be a family again not like before is gonna e different,

i think its gonna work out this time around not like before.

i still love you but i can't
bye bye
to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you back but it's come down to nothing
and all you have is to walk away
from the one thing i thought would never leave me
yeah
picture frame is empty
it's black and white you're smiling down at me
i take your photo off the dash
and back to the conversation
we're so sure of everything
everything we thought we'd always have
lost in the sound of there
the here and the now comes in
seems like i'm becoming
part of your past
bye bye
to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you back but it's come down to nothing
all you have is to walk away
from the one thing i thought would never leave me
and there's so much that i can't touch
you're all i want but it's not enough this time
and i can feel you like you're slipping through my
hands
and i'm so scared of how this ends

"standing on the border
looking out into the great unknown
i can feel my heart beating faster
as i step out on my own
there's a new horizon
and the promise of favorable wind
i'm heading out tonight
traveling light
i'm gonna start all over again
and buy a one way ticket
on a west bound train
see how far i can go
cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
i will face the world around me
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
and i will fall in love again
because i can
gonna climb the mountain
and look the eagle in the eye
i won't let fear clip my wings
and tell me how high i can fly
how could i have ever believed
that love had to be so blind
when freedom was waiting, down at the station
all i had to do was make up my mind
and buy a one way ticket
on a west bound train
see how far i can go
cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
i will face the world around me
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
and i will fall in love again
because i can
well, i have walked through the fire
and crawled on my knees
through the valley of the shadow of doubt
then the truth came shining
like a light on me
and now i can see my way out

on a west bound train
see how far i can go
cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know

gonna sail the ocean
gonna spread my wings
gonna climb that mountain
gonna do everything"
"it keeps me awake
the look on your face
the moment you heard the news
you're screaming inside
and frozen in time
you did all that you could do
the game was rigged, the ref got tricked
the wrong ones think they're right
you were outnumbered — this time
but only the young
only the young
only the young
only the young can run
can run, so run
and run, and run
so every day now
you brace for the sound
you've only heard on tv
you go to class, scared
wondering where the best hiding spot would be
and the big bad man and his big bad clan
their hands are stained with red
oh, how quickly, they forget
they aren't gonna help us
too busy helping themselves
they aren't gonna change this
we gotta do it ourselves
they think that it's over
but it's just begun
only one thing can save us
only the young only the young only the young only the young
only the young only the young only the young only the young
only the young (don't say you're too tired to fight
it's just a matter of time
up there's the finish line)
only the young only the young only the young
can run
don't say you're too tired to fight
it's just a matter of time up there's the finish line
so run, and run, and run
don't say you're too tired to fight
it's just a matter of time up there's the finish line

only the young
only the young
only the young"
"we were standing in an empty room
the moonlight was falling
you were holding my hand
when the car pulled up for you
and i could have spent a life with you
but those days were over
you were calling my name when your face
faded from view
and wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
and wasn't it you who told me:
angels fly in the air tonight
saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
and stars collide and the air's alive
or was it just like those promises that you made
on our last night?
i remember waking up with you
the days doing nothing
you meant more to me then than i think you ever knew.
but you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
a poet at a nobel seminar
i hope the world never tore that out of you
cause wasn't it you who told me the sun
would always chase the day
yeah wasn't it you who told me:
angels fly in the air tonight
saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
and stars collide and the air's alive
or was it just like those promises that you made
on our last night?
and what ever happened to the things you loved
and the songs we played, and the indian days
whatever happened to the things you gave away?
like harold and maude singing
i was waving as you drove away
the sunlight was falling
you were writing backwards in a dusty window pane
angels fly in the air tonight
or was it just like those promises that you made
and stars collide and the air's alive
or was it just like those promises that you made
on our last night?
on our last night?"
"i was ridin' shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says ""baby, is something wrong?""
i say nothin'
i was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song
and he says:
our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh,
the first date, man, i didn't kiss her and i should have
and when i got home
before i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again
i was walkin' up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway
well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said:
our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh,
the first date, man, i didn't kiss her and i should have
and when i got home
before i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again
i've heard every album, listen to the radio,
waitin' for something to come along
that was as good as our song
'cause our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone
and he talks real slow
cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs,
the first date, man, i didn't kiss him and i should have
and when i got home
before i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again
play it again
i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song"
"elevator buttons and morning air,
stranger silence makes me wanna take the stairs.
if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
but right now my time is theirs.
seems like there's always someone who disapproves.
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do.
the jury's out, my choice is you.
so don't you worry your pretty little mind,
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard.
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours.
you never know what people have up their sleeves,
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.
lurking in the shadows with their lipgloss smiles,
but i don't care.
cause right now you're mine.
and you'll say,
so don't you worry your pretty little mind,
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard.
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours.
and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in.
i'll fight their doubts and give you faith with this song for you
cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak.
and any snide remarks from my father
about your tattoos will be ignored
cause my heart is yours
so don't you worry your pretty little mind,
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard.
so don't you worry your pretty little mind,
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours."
"looking at it now, it all seemed so simple
we were lying on your couch
i remember
you took a polaroid of us, then discovered
the rest of the world was black and white
but we were in screaming color

are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?

looking at it now, last december
we were built to fall apart
then fall back together
your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we couldn't quite forget
when we decided, we decided
to move the furniture so we could dance
baby, like we stood a chance
two paper airplanes flying, flying
and i remember thinking
are we out of the woods yet?

remember when you hit the brakes too soon
twenty stitches in a hospital room
when you started crying
baby, i did too
but when the sun came up
i was looking at you
remember when we couldn't take the heat
i walked out, i said ""i'm setting you free""
but the monsters turned out to be just trees
when the sun came up
you were looking at me
you were looking at me, oh
you were looking at me
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods?
i remember

"our coming of age has come and gone
suddenly this summer, it's clear
i never had the courage of my convictions
as long as danger is near
and it's just around the corner, darlin'
'cause it lives in me
no, i could never give you peace
but i'm a fire
and i'll keep your brittle heart warm
if your cascade, ocean wave blues come
all these people think love's for show
but i would die for you in secret
the devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
would it be enough if i could never give you peace?
your integrity makes me seem small
you paint dreamscapes on the wall
i talk shit with my friends
it's like i'm wasting your honor
and you know that i'd swing with you for the fences
sit with you in the trenches
give you my wild, give you a child
give you the silence that only comes
when two people understand each other
family that i chose
now that i see your brother as my brother
is it enough?
but there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
i'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
but the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
but i'm a fire
and i'll keep your brittle heart warm
if your cascade, ocean wave blues come
all these people think love's for show

i'd like to keep you till i'm old
but if i can't at least i know
that baby, perfect have i loved
do you remember the stupid things we used to do
before september stole me away from you
the time we got your truck stuck in the creek
‘cause baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me
if you love me then i love you
swear by the freckles on the moon
and maybe this will be enough
i'd like to keep you till i'm old
but if i can't at least i know
that baby, perfect have i loved
i can still see it
that little bridge we used to cross
i finally made it
trying to get lost
you would smile that smile and i'd try so hard to forget
‘cause of all the little fires that i haven't put out yet
if you love me then i love you
swear by the freckles on the moon
and maybe this will be enough
i'd like to keep you till i'm old
but if i can't at least i know

a long time ago
i ain't jealous of you
just thought you should know
you were never good enough
for him or anything like me
so you might as well sit back
cause i ain't trying to show maturity
x is the shape i drew through your face
in permanent marker, oh yeah
just like the mark you knew you were making
who do you think you are?
to write on his heart in permanent marker
so i found that picture
of you in that green dress
sure had a good time
cleaning up that mess
he found thirty other pieces but he'll never find them all
tried to tape them back together
now he knows to keep it off the wall
x is the shape i drew through your face
in permanent marker, oh yeah
just like the mark you knew you were making
who do you think you are?
to write on his heart in permanent marker
well i don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
the only reason is you're seeing
just how much better off he is
x is the shape i drew through your face
in permanent marker, oh yeah
just like the mark you knew you were making
who do you think you are?
to write on his heart in permanent marker"

i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realized you love yourself
more than you could ever love me

that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine, you won't mind if i say
by the way

you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying

my revenge

from goin' out with all of
your best friends

my daddy's gonna show you
how sorry you'll be

and if you're missin' me
you better keep it to yourself
'cause comin' back around here
would be bad for your health
'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying

on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard

it ended up not having much to say
it said today was for the lovers and believers
i hate to tell you, it just ain't your day
so this is my rain song
it's cold outside and i still love you
guess i was dead wrong
you find out when there's clouds above you
finding it ain't worth losing you
when it all comes down, it comes down to
this lonely rain song
you're on my mind and i still love you
i had some complications with the voices
‘round and going ‘round inside my mind
i used to think this heart had lots of choices
but they all lead to your doorstep every time
so this is my rain song
it's cold outside and i still love you
guess i was dead wrong
you find out when there's clouds above you
finding it ain't worth losing you
when it all comes down, it comes down to
this lonely rain song
you're on my mind and i still love you
so this is my apology
my words, my tears, are all me
laid out in front of you
like the thought were true on a sunny afternoon
this is a song for you

"loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead end street
faster than the wind passionate as sin end so suddenly
loving him is like tryin'a change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lost it all
losing him was blue, like i've never known
missing him was dark grey, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite songs
fighting with him was like tryin'a solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you'd never find out that love could be that strong
losing him was blue, like i've never known
missing him was dark grey, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
burning red
remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes
telling myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head
burning red
loving him was red
oh, losing him was blue, like i've never known
missing him was dark grey, all alone
forgetting him was like tryin'a know somebody you never met
‘cause loving him was red
we're burning red
and that's why he's spinning round in my head
comes back to me burning red
his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead end street"
"it's 10am, i catch the morning train,
and there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,
saying ""hey, i've been waiting for ya"".
we'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,
we'd go so loud, but we don't care,
cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.
you'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,
and just like that i swear it's like we've known each other our whole lives.
and this moment is perfect.
train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.
don't you dare be quiet.
this journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.
lets take the ride of our lives.
this is the moment where the chemistry happens,
yeah that special connection.
these are the days of our lives.
these are the times you'll never forget.
never regret as long as we ride here side by side.
we can speak, we can dream,
this is our time, you and me,
lets have the ride of our lives.
as we watch the world outside the window past,
i'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.
it's hard not to laugh out loud baby when you crack a joke.
you've got me smiling, got me thinking that i've got it all.
you make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,
cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.
i don't ever want this train ride to come to an end,
but when it does baby, we can do it all over again.
and the train's coming to a stop,
i'm still so lost in you i can't bare to get off.
you kiss me on the spot.

matches burn after the other
pages turn and stick to each other

still sitting in a corner i haunt
cross legged in the dim light
they say, ""what a sad sight""
i, i swear you could hear a hair pin drop
right when i felt the moment stop
glass shattered on the white cloth
everybody moved on, i, i stayed there
dust collected on my pinned up hair
they expected me to find somewhere
some perspective, but i sat and stared
right where you left me
you left me no, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
you left me, you left me no, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever

time went on for everybody else
she won't know it, she's still twenty three inside her fantasy
how it was supposed to be
did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
she's still twenty three inside her fantasy
and you're sitting in front of me
at the restaurant when i was still the one you want
cross legged in the dim light everything was just right
i, i could feel the mascara run
you told me that you met someone
glass shattered on the white cloth
everybody moved on
help, i'm still at the restaurant
still sitting in a corner i haunt
cross legged in the dim light
they say, ""what a sad sight""
i, i stayed there
dust collected on my pinned up hair
i'm sure that you got a wife out there
kids and christmas, but i'm unaware
cause i'm right where i cause no harm
mind my business
if our love died young
i can't bear witness
and it's been so long
but if you ever think you got it wrong
i'm right where
you left me
you left me no, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
you left me
you left me no, you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever"

i still got love for you

passed down like folk songs

i think your house is haunted
your dad is always mad and that must be why

and just like a folk song
our love will be passed on

"it's strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you: feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes...
you should've said no, you should've gone home
you should've thought twice before you let it all go
you should've know that word, but what you did with her
would get back to me...
and i should've been there, in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said no, baby and you might still have me
you can see that i've been crying
and baby you know all the right things: to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same...
you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes...
you should've said no, you should've gone home
you should've thought twice before you let it all go
you should've know that word, but what you did with her
would get back to me...
and i should've been there, in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said no, baby and you might still have me
i can't resist... before you go, tell me this
was it worth it...
was she worth this...
no... no no no...
you should've said no, you should've gone home
you should've thought twice before you let it all go
you should've know that word, but what you did with her
would get back to me...
and i should've been there, in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...

feel the warmth
on my hand

what a piece
of driftwood
has seen all through
his lifetime

a million things
spoke a million words
now i only want
to speak to you
waiting for the words
counting every bird

i'd rather do
on the
smokey black nights
still through
the haze
i can make out
constellations
i'll make one
of you and me
as we sit
in the sand
and i saw
that sunset gleamin
as my eyes went wild
let's walk away
the past through
the smokey black nights
i've played
a thousand songs
sang a thousand words
now i only want
to sing to you
waited on a wire
starin' at the fire
there's nothing
i'd rather do
on the
smokey black nights
i've walked
a thousand miles
smiled
a thousand smiles
now i only smile
when i'm with you
waiting for the words
counting every bird

i'd rather do
on the
smokey black nights

as the sweet
wind dances
i'll write a song
for you and me

smokey black nights"

"i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion.
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl.
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastels
and she is yelling at a brides maid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastery
this is surely not what you'd thought it would be.
i lose myself in a daydream.
better stand and say,
don't say yes.
run away now.
i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.
don't wait or say a single vow.
you need to hear me out and they said speak now.
fun gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play a song
that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvided by your lovely bride to be.
she floats down the isle like a pageant queen.
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me
don't you?
don't say yes
run away now
i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.
don't wait or say a single vow.
you need to hear me out and they said speak now.
don't say yes
run away now
i'll meet you when you're out at the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow.
your time is running out and they said speak now.
oooooh, la la la, oh
oooooh, la la la, oh
i hear the preacher say
""speak now or forever hold your peace""
there's the silence
there's my last chance
i stand up with shaky hands
all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i'm only looking at you.
i am not the kind of girl,
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion.
but you are not the kind of boy,
who should be marrying the wrong girl.
so don't say yes
run away now
i'll meet you in your alt at the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow.
you need to hear me out, said speak now.
and you say
lets run away now
i'll meet you in an alt in my tux at the back door
hey hey, i didn't say my vow
so glad you were around when they said speak now."
"days go by, i wonder if you hear me
can't you read between the lines
now i'm standing still, i am disappearing
take this chance, i'll make you mine
and don't you wonder why
you change in time
makes you feel so empty inside
but love's got me cornered in the back of the room
i'm spinning around, spinning around
and all i see is someone i don't know
love's got me tangled, tired me too
no sign of a wall, sign of a wall
spinning me around
and baby all i see is you
he tells lies, are you really thinking
that you deserve another try
and when you see these eyes you see another planet
don't ask how, but fate decides
and don't you wonder why
you change in time
makes you feel so empty inside
but love's got me cornered in the back of the room
i'm spinning around, spinning around
and all i see is someone i don't know
love's got me tangled, tired me too
no sign of a wall, sign of a wall
spinning me around

spinning and turning and living and learning
i should be able to handle this
make it or break it, move it or shake it
do it or fake it, girl you've got to make it

i'm spinning around, spinning around
and all i see is someone i don't know
love's got me tangled, tired me too

spinning me around

honeysuckle on the breeze, wilson county creek

baby you were watching me
cold barn, truck bed
everything you said slowly educating me
i never had a lesson so sweet
you can get high on a first kiss
you can get by on sweet tea and god's graces
you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and come back someone new

autumn rain, windowpane
look at how the leaves changed, just like the two of us
i've still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
guess i loved you way too much
now i'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder

it's the same to me

you could call me ""babe"" for the weekend

i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you in my hometown
i parkеd my car right between the methodist
and thе school that used to be ours
the holidays linger like bad perfume
you can run, but only so far
i escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave

time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
now i'm missing your smile, hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you in my hometown
sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
i won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
so i'll go back to l. a. and the so called friends
who'll write books about me, if i ever make it
and wonder about the only soul
who can tell which smiles i'm fakin'
and the heart i know i'm breakin' is my own
to leave the warmest bed i've ever known
we could call it even
even though i'm leavin'
and i'll be yours for the weekend

we could call it even
you could call me ""babe"" for the weekend

this heart will start a riot in me
let's start, start, hey!
why do we like to hurt so much?
oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
now i can't trust myself with anything but this
and that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa"
"combat, i'm ready for combat
i say i don't want that, but what if i do?
'cause cruelty wins in the movies
i've got a hundred thrown out speeches i almost said to you
easy they come, easy they go
i jump from the train, i ride off alone
i never grew up, it's getting so old
help me hold on to you
i've been the archer, i've been the prey
who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay?
dark side, i search for your dark side
but what if i'm alright, right, right, right here?
and i cut off my nose just to spite my face
then i hate my reflection for years and years
i wake in the night, i pace like a ghost
the room is on fire, invisible smoke
and all of my heroes die all alone
help me hold on to you
i've been the archer, i've been the prey
screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay?
'cause they see right through me
they see right through me
they see right through
can you see right through me?
they see right through
they see right through me
i see right through me
i see right through me
all the king's horses, all the king's men
couldn't put me together again
'cause all of my enemies started out friends
help me hold on to you
i've been the archer, i've been the prey
who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay?
who could stay?
who could stay?
who could stay?
you could stay
you could stay
combat, i'm ready for combat"

my big coat on

the tractor rides

i hug your legs and fall asleep
on the way home
i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow whites house is near or far away

with you today

and don't know how my friends
could be so mean
i come home crying
and you hold me tight
and grab the keys

far enough away
and we talk and window shop
until i forgot all their names
i don't know who i'm gonna talk to
now at school
but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay

with you today
i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out
he's better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house
and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you
there is a video
i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen
and youre talking to me
it's the age of princesses and pirate ships
and the seven dwarves
daddy's smart
and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side
even when i was wrong

eulogize me?
i'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
these hunters with cell phones

those windermere peaks
look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off

what should be over
burrowed under my skin
in heart stopping waves of hurt
i've come too far to watch some name dropping sleaze
tell me what are my words worth

where all poets went to die
i don't belong
and, my beloved, neither do you
those windermere peaks
look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off

i want auroras and sad prose
i want to watch wisteria grow
right over my bare feet
cause i haven't moved in years
and i want you right here
a red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
with no one around to tweet it
while i bathe in cliffside pools
with my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
take me to the lakes
where all poets went to die
i don't belong
and, my beloved, neither do you

i've been gettin'
a little lazy
waitin' on you to come save me

every weekend the same party

everything i'm going through
i drive down different roads

didn't read the note on the polaroid picture
they don't know how much i miss you

i miss you like it was the very first night
and so it was
we never saw it coming
not trying to fall in love
but we did like children running
back then we didn't know
we were built to fall apart
we broke the status quo
then we broke each other's hearts
but don't forget about the night out in l. a
dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
no one knows about the words that we whisper
no one knows how much i miss you
i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
i'd write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night
take me away
take me away
take me away
to you, to you
take me away
take me away
take me away
to you, to you
i remember the night at the hotel
i was riding in the car when we both fell
i'm the one on the phone as you whisper
""do you know how much i miss you? ""

""i miss you like it was the very first night""
i wish i could fly
i'd pick you up and we'd go back in time

and so long
should have fit like a glove
should have fit like a ring
like a diamond ring
a token of true love
should have all worked out
but it didn't
she should be here now
but she isn't
there's your trouble,
there's your trouble
you keep seeing double
with the wrong one
you can't see i love you,
you can't see she doesn't
but you just keep holding on
there's your trouble
so now you're thinking 'bout
all you're missing
how deep you're sinking,
round and round and dragging down
why don't you cash in your chips
why don't you call it a loss
not such a big loss,
chalk it up better luck
could have been true love
but it wasn't
it should all add up
but it doesn't
there's your trouble,
there's your trouble
you keep seeing double
with the wrong one
you can't see i love you,
you can't see she doesn't
but you just keep holding on
there's your trouble
should have all worked out
but it didn't
she should be here now
but she isn't
there's your trouble,
there's your trouble
you keep seeing double
with the wrong one
you can't see i love you,
you can't see she doesn't
but you just keep holding on
there's your trouble"
"i walked into a chair today
'cause i was thinking 'bout you
your face jumped right in my way
like lately things do
oh, baby, can't you see?
the thought of you makes a mess of me
i walked into a chair today
'cause i was thinking 'bout you
and now i
i can't walk straight, i can't talk straight
i can't think about anything but the way
it should be and it could be
and 'till you come 'round again i will be
doing what i usually do
thinking 'bout you
i get lost when i drive around town
thinking 'bout your smile
i always end up on your side of town
and i don't know why
there must be something under this hood
that's got a mighty strong liking to you
i walked into a chair today
'cause i was thinking 'bout you
lately
i can't walk straight, i can't talk straight
i can't think about anything but the way
it should be and it could be
and until you come 'round again i will be
doing what i usually do
thinking 'bout you
your eyes are the color of
the deep blue sea
the one that i go swimming in
every time you look at me
i can't walk straight, i can't talk straight
i can't think about anything but the way
it should be and it could be
and 'till you come 'round again i will be
doing what i usually do
thinking about you
i walked into a chair today
'cause i was thinking 'bout you"
"stumbled off the porch steps
sat down in the car
only thirteen blocks across this town
to get to where you are
and that don't offer me much time
to make up my mind
so i best be driving slow
on my way to letting go
these headlights they just want to fade
off into the night
but if they're half as stubborn as me
they'll just keep shining bright
i ain't ever been one to settle
like the dust that's on the dash
and since the feeling ain't strong
i'll just move on and leave this in my past
once you're gone i know your memory
will somehow get the best of me
so why question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wondering about how i feel today
until you found somebody new
so i've been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i might miss you that much
but you can't call it love if you ain't in it
red light turns to green
then back to red again
i wish there were some other travelers
out here
to slow my traveling
even though i can't hold on
inside i still don't know
oh, and it troubles me so
once you're gone i know your memory
will somehow get the best of me
so why question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wondering about how i feel today
until you found somebody new
so i've been holding
on way too long

i might miss you that much

the car comes to a rest in the drive
you open up the door and i see you smile"
"walking downtown shuffling my feet
i try to dream my dreams above the concrete
store windows, traveled for miles
but something i passed really caught my eye
it was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
but i fell in love with this here guitar
nice to meet you, can i teach you
all i know, can you show me what you do
where have you been
what have you seen
who were you before you even knew me
have you been played for endless hours
or were you left in the corner
or were you someone's best friend
this here guitar
it was my baby, anyone could see
i love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
but i can't help wondering why
it came to me and where we'll say goodbye
the cracks down the middle
can't see where they are
since i fell in love with this here guitar
nice to meet you, can i teach you
all i know, can you show me what you do
where have you been
what have you seen
who were you before you even knew me
have you been played for endless hours
or were you left in the corner
or were you someone's best friend
this here guitar
were you a present from a father to a son
did he forget you
or just play you 'til you came undone
hey did some prima donna love you
'til she got her fame and fortune
i won't do that to you
nice to meet you, i can teach you
all i know, you can show me what you do
where have you been
what have you seen
who were you before you even knew me
and i played you for endless hours
never left you in the corner
you're my one and only friend
now i know where life lessons are
this here guitar
you're my guitar
this here guitar"
"beneath the chandelier of star and atmosphere
tangled like the roots on the ground
the windows opened up
the wind is blowing and were both not making a sound
it's like i'm melting on into you
give me a reason why we should ever move
and
tell me
you'll never leave me
and i'm not crazy and
this is really happening
that this is really happening
could this be better ?
you write me letters
so you see me everyday
you tend to treat me like
my name is up in lights
it really blows me away
lock me up in a dark room
and i still can't take my eyes off you
tell me
you'll never leave me
and i'm not crazy and
this is really happening
that this is really happening
all those kiss up against your car
for all those wishes on planes
we thought were stars
memories like photographs
oh baby, here we are
tell me
you'll never leave me
and i'm not crazy and
oh,this is really happening
that this is really happening
oh,oh,baby
tell me
you'll always need me
that i drive you crazy

oh,that this is really happening
tell me,oh
you'll always need me
that i drive you crazy

"it was so nice throwing big parties
jumping in the pool from the balcony
everyone swimming in a champagne sea
and there are no rules when you show up here
bass beat rattling the chandelier
feeling so gatsby for that whole year
so why'd you have to rain on my parade?
i'm shaking my head
i'm locking the gates
this is why we can't
have nice things, darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we can't have
nice things, honey
did you think i wouldn't hear
all the things you said about me?
this is why we can't
have nice things
it was so nice being friends again
there i was giving you a second chance
but then you stabbed my back
while shaking my hand
and therein lies the issue
friends don't try to trick you
get you on the phone and mind twist you
and so i took an ax to a mended fence
but i'm not the only friend
you've lost lately
if only you weren't
so shady
this is why we can't have
nice things, darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we can't have
nice things, honey
did you think i wouldn't hear
all the things you said about me?
this is why we can't have
here's a toast to my real friends
they don't care about that he said, she said
and here's to my baby
he ain't reading what
they call me lately
and here's to my momma
had to listen to all this drama
and here's to you
'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
haha, i can't even say it with a straight face
this is why we can't have
nice things, darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we can't have
nice things, honey
did you think i wouldn't hear
all the things you said about me?
this is why we can't have

"clear blue water, high tides came
and brought you in
and i could go on and on, on and on
and i will
skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
and you are just gone and gone
and gone, and gone
in silent screams and wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this
this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
tossing, turning
struggled through the night
with someone new
and i could go on and on
on and on
lantern burning
flickered in my mind for only you
but you're still gone, and gone
and gone, and gone
in losing grip and sinking ships
you showed up just in time
this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love, this love, this love
your kiss, my cheek
i watched you leave
your smile, my ghost
i fell to my knees
when you're young, you just run
but you come back to what you need
this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free

"seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty
but that's not true, cause i know you...
hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it
and letting go... and no one knows
you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh, cause it's not his price to pay
not his price to pay...
hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it
and letting go... and no one knows
you cry, but you don't tell anyone

"do you remember the day i leaned up against your car?
and it started rolling down the street
you screamed and ran after it
tried to open the door and it ran over your foot
and i was too busy laughing on the ground to see
it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
and i'm mad at all the lovebirds
cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
wish that all the road's would lead you
right to me
cause that's where you belong
til brad pitt comes along
do you remember the time we watched carrie
and you said it reminded you of me
and i threw the remote at you a
and you said ""my point exactly""
later on that night under the
neon city lights you paid a homeless guy
to sing a song to me and
it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
and i'm mad at all the lovebirds
cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
wish that all the road's would lead you
right to me
cause that's where you belong
til brad pitt comes along
you call me unlucky cause i
lose everything
but i swear i'd be careful with it
if you gave me a ring
it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
and i'm mad at all the lovebirds
cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
wish that all the road's would lead you
right to me

"you said the way my blue eyes shined,
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said: ""that's a lie""
just a boy in a chevy truck,
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
on backroads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone
but when you think: tim mcgraw,
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long:
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness,
i hope you think: ""that little black dress""
think of my head on your chest,
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw,
i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears,
and thankin' god that you weren't here,
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed,
is a letter that you never read,
from three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,
and lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe:
when you think: tim mcgraw,
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long:
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness,
i hope you think: ""that little black dress""
think of my head on your chest,
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw,
i hope you think of me
and i'm back for the first time since then:
i'm standin' on your street,
and there's a letter left on your doorstep,
and the first thing that you'll read is
when you think: tim mcgraw,
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on,
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness,
i hope you think: ""that little black dress""
think of my head on your chest,
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw,
i hope you think of me
oh, think of me,
mmmm
you said the way my blue eyes shined,
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said: ""that's a lie"""

"i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
listened as the crowd would sing
""now the old king is dead! long live the king!""
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs is singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest word
that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king?
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field

if i could write a book on how this hurts
if you could see the way your smile looks to me
if i wasn't scared of the world alone
if i didn't know he loves me so
if i could only find the strength to leave
you'd be with me, so baby
don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait for me
it's so wrong that all i wanna do
is forget it all and just be with you
i have to go ‘cause he don't know
but the writing's on the wall
but here we are in so deep
soaking wet
jumping in without no safety net
and i don't know what kinda ropes
would break this kinda fall, so baby
don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go, i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait, wait for me
we can't be together right now
guess there's no use in trying
but if you look at me right now
can you tell that i'm dying
to hold you
but it would be wrong to
so don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade

when the porch lights were shining bright
before i had somewhere to be
back when we had all night
and we were happy
i do recall a good while back
we snuck into the circus
you threw your arms around my neck
back when i deserved it
and we were happy
when it was good baby
it was good baby
we showed them all how
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark
talking about your daddy's farm
we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
we used to watch the sun go down
on the boats in the water
that's sort of how i feel right now
and goodbye's so much harder
'cause we were happy
when it was good baby
it was good baby
we showed them all how
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark
talking about your daddy's farm
we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
oh, i hate those voices
telling me i'm not in love anymore
but they don't give me choices
and that's what these tears are for
'cause we were happy
we were happy
when it was good baby
it was good baby
we showed them all how
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark
talking about your daddy's farm
and you were gonna marry me

swore i'd never let a man in my way
you're the last thing i needed today
and i don't know
where i lost control
and couldn't take it any longer
must have been somewhere between
your smile and the way you say my name
i can't win so i give in
the more i fight it just get's stronger
you're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
welcome distraction, welcome distraction
gone and spilled my coffee
tryna get to the phone
'cause it might be you
you just never know
can't talk to my friends
without you coming up
it's even kind of cute
the way you cuss
i wrote your name down
a hundred thousand times
'cause it looks so good
right next to mine
you're the last thing i needed tonight
and i don't know
where i lost control
and couldn't take it any longer
must have been somewhere between
your smile and the way you say my name
i can't win so i give in
the more i fight it just get's stronger
you're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

i'm acting like a girl
with nothing to lose
when did i stop caring
about anything but you
and i don't know
where i lost control

"he said, ""let's get out of this town
drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
i thought, ""heaven can't help me now""
nothing lasts forever
but this is gonna take me down
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad, but he does it so well
i can see the end as it begins
my one condition is
say you'll remember me
standin' in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your
wildest dreams, ah, ha
wildest dreams, ah, ha
i said, ""no one has to know what wе do""
his hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
and his voicе is a familiar sound
nothin' lasts forever
but this is gettin' good now
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad, but he does it so well
and when we've had our very last kiss
my last request it is
say you'll remember me
standin' in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your
wildest dreams, ah, ha wildest dreams, ah, ha
you'll see me in hindsight
tangled up with you all night
burnin' it down
someday, when you leave me
i bet these memories
follow you around
you'll see me in hindsight
tangled up with you all night
burnin'  it  down someday, when you leave me
i bet these memories
follow  you  around 
say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just pretend
say you'll remember me
standin' in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah, ha in your wildest dreams, ah, ha
even if it's just in your

rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife

"flashing lights
and we took a wrong turn
and we fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
'cause nothing's as it seems
and spinning out of control
didn't they tell us
""don't rush into things""
didn't you flash your green eyes at me
haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twisting around me
i should've slept with one eye open at night
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better
in wonderland, in wonderland
in wonderland, in wonderland
so we went on our way
too in love to think straight
all alone, or so it seemed
but there were strangers watching
and whispers turned to talking
and talking turned to screams
didn't they tell us
""don't rush into things""
didn't you flash your green eyes at me
didn't you calm my fears
with with a cheshire cat smile?
didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twisting around me
it's all fun and games 'til somebody
loses their mind
but darling, we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better
in wonderland, in wonderland
in wonderland, in wonderland
i reached for you, but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for something else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end, in wonderland
we both went mad
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it

"i can't believe you did it again
walk by and took my heart with you
why'd you have to look so good?
don't you know i'm trying to hate you?
trying to have a dream without you in it
but how can i put out this fire, when you're the one who lit it?
i can't wait for the day
i stop pretending i'm really ok when i'm not
i wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
until i do i'll keep writing songs about you
i got a stack of papers so high
and it's all about you baby
keep thinking maybe i can make sense of something crazy,
something i can't get out of my head
i write your name, i write your name,
then i tear it all to shreads
i can't wait for the day
i stop pretending i'm really ok when i'm not
i wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
until i do i'll keep writing songs about you
and if you ever change your mind,
it won't be back again
i hope these songs will remind me
why i shouldn't let you in
i can't wait for the day
i stop pretending i'm really ok cause i'm not
i wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
until i do
i'll just wait for the day
i stop pretending i'm really ok when i'm not
i wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
until i do i'll keep writing songs about you"
"one look, dark room
meant just for you
time moved too fast, you play it back
buttons on a coat
lighthearted joke
no proof, not much, but you saw enough
small talk, he drives
coffee at midnight
moonlight reflects the chain on your neck
he says ""look up""
and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch and you felt enough
you can hear it in the silence, the silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you are in love
morning, his place
burnt toast, sunday
you keep his shirt, he keeps his word
for once, you let go
of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much, but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks
you fight and you talk
one night he wakes, strange look on his face
pauses, then says, ""you're my best friend""
and you knew what it was
he is in love
you can hear it in the silence, the silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
so it goes
you two are dancing in a snowglobe round and round
and he keeps a picture of you
in his office downtown
and you understand now why
they lost their minds, and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life
trying to put it into words
'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love
you are in love
you can hear it in the silence, the silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you can hear it in the silence, the silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you are in love"
"you're on the phone with your girlfriend

i'm in my room

she doesn't like
she'll never know your story
like i do
but she wears short skirts, i wear t shirts

dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

who understands you
been here all along

laughing on a park bench thinking to myself

we could let our friends crash in the living room
this is our place, we make the call
and i'm highly suspicious
that everyone who sees you wants you
i've loved you three summers now, honey
but i want 'em all
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close forever and ever?
and ah, take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my lover
ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
with every guitar string scar on my hand
i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
all's well that ends well to end up with you
swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
and at every table, i'll save you a seat, lover
can i go where you go?
can we always be this close forever and ever?
and ah, take me out, and take me home
you're my, my, my, my
oh, you're my, my, my, my
darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
"all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances everytime and all you do is let me down
and its taking me this long baby but i figured you out
and you think it will be fine again but not this time around
you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone

don't want to hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby like i did before
you're not sorry... no, no, no, no
lookin' so innocent
i might believe you if i didn't know
could'a loved you all my life
if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
and you got your share of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know
and now you're asking me to listen
cuz its worked each time before
but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw

"bet you lie awake at night,
trying to make up your sweet mind
wondering if you'll ever find just what you want
a home town number one or a california loaded gun
but you know you'll make it one,
well that's what you thought
here's what you got:
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes inthe knees
in the bottom of the top drawer.
i could be your little beauty queen,
just a little out of reach,
or the girl living next door.
i'll be your angel giving up her wings.
if that's what you need,
i'd give everything to be your anything.
be your anything
if you want hard to get, if you want... all you have to do is let me know.
if you want a bumpy ride, or someone with a softer side
either one'll be alright, just let me know.
is this where we go?
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes inthe knees
in the bottom of the top drawer.
i could be your little beauty queen,
just a little out of reach,
or the girl living next door.
i'll be your angel giving up her wings.
if that's what you need,
i'd give everything to be your anything.
be your anything
it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you
but with someone like you, it's just so easy to do.
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes inthe knees
in the bottom of the top drawer.
i could be your little beauty queen,
just a little out of reach,
or the girl living next door.
i'll be your angel giving up her wings.
if that's what you need,
i'd give everything to be your anything.

"i heard a song
tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
she sees his face
in every space, every room
and i know that
if i turn around you
won't be there
if i close my eyes
will you be there?
chorus:
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared
of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
i've got a picture of you
in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
i hope i never lose that feelin
i used to get when you called
and then i wonder to myself
who are you, where are you
where you ever here at all?
chorus:
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared
of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
that girl in the song
had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes
and see you
i wish the sky had your face
and the oceans had your eyes
and the sunset had your lips
and i had you
chorus:
oh, yeah
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared
of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
oh, no, no
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna turn around
oh, oh, oh"
